24,Pilot1922,1624613288.0,o7k9ii,6,6,"I‚Äôm a cashier who has been working at Walmart for a couple weeks, and Walmart is my very first job.

One thing I‚Äôve noticed is that there are several times where I‚Äôm literally the only one working at a lane. Despite Walmart having like 15 lanes for checkout, I commonly find myself frustrated, especially during evening shifts, as the lane I am working at is usually the only one open. Obviously lines will get long, and I find myself getting tired and more vulnerable to making mistakes at the register. A lot of customers have even sympathized with me for being the only register that is open.

The weird thing I find though, is that the Walmart I specifically work at isn‚Äôt even understaffed. There‚Äôs plenty of front-end workers, but for some reason a lot of them are tasked with doing inventory or just help pushing carts. Meanwhile, there‚Äôs usually only like 1 or 2 lanes open. 

This is a genuine question, but does Walmart specifically do this on purpose?  Is it like this at every Walmart as well? What‚Äôs the reasoning or logic behind it?",walmart,Do all Walmart‚Äôs purposely have few lanes open?,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/o7k9ii/do_all_walmarts_purposely_have_few_lanes_open/

Alright so I found another opportunity at another company and gave my notice to Walmart. I hadn‚Äôt started the new company or anything and wasn‚Äôt planning on it until after the notice obviously. Store manager calls me into the office two hours into one of my shifts and fires me for working for a competitor. But I hadn‚Äôt started yet. And clearly I wasn‚Äôt planning on working for both. Is it worth going to ethics? The store manager is a really douche and is the main reason I was leaving and here this is topping it off. Is it worth fighting it?

I feel like I‚Äôve been unofficially elected a team lead as I have all the responsibilities they do in terms of dealing with unruly customers and difficult situations. My manager and team leads almost always get off before 4-6 where dispense becomes absolute hell. 
Now that it‚Äôs summer it‚Äôs been especially bad as we‚Äôre a tourist town and our order numbers have raised, even tho we still have so many call ins and not enough closing staff. 
Ever sense the coming of graduation/ summer we have been severely short staffed, and corporate doesn‚Äôt give a single F (even my manager and store manager have asked to lower orders due to it). We have had a full house+ for weeks on end. They all show 15mins to the time they should. Half the time we don‚Äôt have the orders for their time separated and up in the dispense room. 
I am happy that I am finally going to move to days, but I know I will be asked to stay late almost all the time. My only other good co-worker is going to be moving to auto, which leaves only the newly graduated kids and kids still in highschool. While I love most of the kids I work with, I know closing is going to go to hell without me and my co-worker. I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty for changing shifts, even tho I know it will lessen my stress and make me able to spend time with my BF again. 
I‚Äôve tryed my best to train the kids I know are good for the responsibilities I‚Äôm gonna leave them em with. I just hope they take to it fully. I‚Äôve always felt that I‚Äôve had to be the responsible one, so leaving them to take my place as leader will be kind of hard. I know some of them are capable but a lot of them give of spoiled ‚ÄúI live off daddy‚Äôs money‚Äù vibes.

I graduated high school in May and have a couple scholarship options for some state and private colleges nearby. I don‚Äôt come from a family with lots in the bank though, unfortunately, and even if I take advantages of the scholarships I have available I will still throw myself into 5 figure debt. 

Today I learned about the live better u program which can essentially get you a degree for $400 a year, so long as you maintain employment at Walmart. This was astonishing to me and the thought of getting a degree with no debt afterwords is extremely appealing. I know I will be giving up the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù, but I need to do what is best for my financial future. Going through 4 more years of an understaffed front end will no doubt be tough, but I‚Äôm willing and able to do it if it means I can get a degree for next to half a paycheck a YEAR.

No one at my store told me that). So anyway, we all got spoken to recently because our first time pick rate is abysmal. I guess salaried felt like we were the ones to place all the blame on to. My accuracy was just about where it should be, but they basically told me if my accuracy doesn‚Äôt improve there will be consequences. The whole time I was here, no one ever told me how important accuracy was, I was always given the impression pick rate and speed were more important. So I would nil pick something if I couldn‚Äôt find it quickly. No one really explained these metrics to me as a whole, not even when I got pulled in the office and talked to. There‚Äôs a lot they didn‚Äôt tell me, I feel like. They get mad about people not performing the way they want them to, when they didn‚Äôt really train said person to the best of their abilities. Typical Walmart logic, right. Anyway, enough about my rant but my fellow OGP people/pickers, I would like some tips. I don‚Äôt want them to feel like I‚Äôm a problem because I‚Äôm not. I honestly thought I was doing a good job, 2 months and this is the first time they have really said much of anything. My accuracy is just about where it should be, and that was their biggest concern. My pick rate is fine, I could stand to do bigger quantity runs, etc. I just feel it‚Äôs kind of sad Reddit is sometimes a better source of information on how to do your job than the people at your store. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",walmart,"So what affects first time pick rate, and how can I make changes to make it better?",https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/o737hv/so_what_affects_first_time_pick_rate_and_how_can/

I've been threatened by my Manager after trying to compromise my scheduling to eventually being as a par-time Flex. Issue is now, out of the blue I'm no long par time flex and now got 5 shifts a week where I can only work 1-2 a week.
Knowing how managers are here it's ""your"" responsibility to fill those shifts is what they say even so I signed a form to be part time flex a year ago.

I was then informed that he needed direct care for COVID for a bit so I was going to be forced to stay home for a little while more. So I asked sedgwick what I should do because it's family care but it's related to COVID, and they informed me I should extend my COVID leave so I extended it to June 13th. I assumed by that point, my family member would be good to go. So my leave ended, and I wasn't put back on the schedule right away. Last week, I was scheduled for July 4th so I assumed I was good to go to return. 

Today, I got a notification in the app about schedule changes. So I checked, thinking maybe they put me on sooner as well. It said my scheduled shifts were removed, and in the talk part of the app it says ""You can not talk to other associates since you are not on (store number)'s roster."" It also doesn't let me log in on the web browser saying my account was disabled by administer. 

Does it sound like I terminated while on a COVID leave? I've been trying to call my store but I get a busy signal literally every time, so kind of can't find out yet.

I‚Äôm in OGP and most of the staffs are females so in the beginning I didn‚Äôt have this issue but later on I came out of my shell and try to socialize with them even joke around in a friendly way but I had a hard time cutting down bc I enjoyed it so much but recently it‚Äôs gone sour and now I think they‚Äôre bullying me in a mean way bc I did it so much. I stopped talking to majority of them but I still think they‚Äôre bullying me. It‚Äôs even gotten physical one girl hit my arm with a box and I did hit her back and some dude recorded the whole thing and this other girl videod me in the break room of me watching a youtube video and told the workplace groupchat that I watch porn and masturbate to it which I don‚Äôt do. This story is getting long but basically i‚Äôm being bullied by these girls and they‚Äôre being rude asf to me and I feel I can‚Äôt report em bc I bullied them back and even laid my hands on em to intimidate them but they still bully me. I know guys shouldn‚Äôt hit girls but they hit me enough times. I even rammmed them with my ogp cart. I‚Äôm surprised the managers don‚Äôt know about this.

186,Feather-Mutt,1624507400.0,o6t5t9,2,3,"So I've been working at Walmart (CAP2) since September of 2020, its my first ever job and I was busting ass until about February. I was made full time after Valentines Day but then that very same day I messed up the rotator cuff on my shoulder really bad while working the truck and had to take a leave for two weeks until I healed. Took a bit longer to do stuff when I got back, but my coach and TL was fine with it, I had just healed and all. I picked up the pace trying to get back at the level I was at but then my mental health took a nosedive and then some major family problems with my fathers health and my mom's housing situation came up. I am across the country so all I can do is worry about it instead of helping, and unfortunately it affected my work. 

Then I had to take a Covid Leave, which was about a week or two after coming back from healing, and literally two days later once I get back from the Leave, TL and Coach give me a warning, telling me to pick up my pace and that I had fallen behind ever since becoming full time and that work came first, to leave family stuff at the door. (I'm a worrier, so that's very hard for me to do lol) They said some other shit too, like how me not working hard looked bad on them, and that they weren't gonna be buddy buddy with me, that they didn't give a shit about anything but themselves and their job and nothing was gonna get in the way of their job, they had a family to take care of, blah blah blah). I took it, because I knew I deserved it. I could tell that I was slowing down, so I tried to pick up the pace again and bust ass, but not even a month later, they said I still wasn't at the level I was at during the beginning, and they coach me. At this point, this job is the only thing keeping me afloat ($17/hr, which is one of the highest paying jobs in my town, and I don't drive so this is about the only thing I can get) so with this major kick in the ass, I literally work myself to the bone. My coworkers have even told me to stop working so fast because they don't want me to get heatstroke lmao.

 But now it seems that no matter how fast I move, I literally don't get anything done. Like, I'll be in HBA with 7-8 hours of freight+totes, and even with help I'll still only get done at 9-10:30, whereas before I'll be done completely by 8:30-9. Or I'll be in One Touch with only 120 Break Packs to sort, but it will still take me until lunch or after to get it done. Before, I could finish 135+ either before lunch or when the truck finished, depending on how much stuff was in there, but now it seems I'm getting slower. Literally today I did *Paper"", honestly one of the easiest departments, and it was only 4 1/2 hours, and yet it still took me all day, even with busting my butt. ( To be fair though a lot of customers stopped me to help them in drinks/grocery but that's not an excuse) My Coach came by after clocking out and was like ""You're *STILL* in Paper?!"" while I was working truck freight, and then walked away pissed off after giving me a ""Whatever"" look and rolling her eyes.

My TL said she'd work with me Friday to see WTF was going on and to see if it's anything I'm doing or if it's other shit or what so she can give advice, which is good, but my Coach seemed pretty pissed off, so I'm really worried about that.

 I don't know what the fuck is happening. It's like the faster I move the less freight gets done. Idk if it's Burnout or what but it's getting to the point where I'm scared I'm gonna get Coached again if this shit keeps up. I like my job and my coworkers, but this is seriously messing with my health, both mental and physical. And if I get Coached again, I'll be in Orange, which mean I won't be able to transfer. I was hoping to transfer to Overnights because the pay is higher and the Coach is actually nice, (His nickname is literally Smiley lmao) but now I'm not even sure I'll be able to with all of this going on. 

Idk what to do. At this point I'm thinking it's either quit or be fired or moved to another department that isn't freight related. And I don't want to do any of those. Do any of y'all have any advice or anything?

1. Do they expect me to spend the entire time looking for/pushing carts?

So in other words, can I take a ""break"" for 60 seconds?

2. From what I understand, even though I'm  on carts they at times call you to do other things. But like... how often will they come outside just to find me and bring me in? Also, will they teach me how to do the temporary job for a while?

3. Is there a way I can carry water with me outside? Because like.... it's HOT. Someone who worked there a little longer than me made what I'm hoping was joke that I was tired and sweaty but I had been working 4 hours by then and the sun was just setting, should I not have been tired?

4. If any of you have pushed carts up hill: any tips to keep it from swerving or falling. Or in general to keep ALL carts connected (keep in mind we have no machine).

269,Pilot1922,1624440492.0,o69d7z,12,9,"I recently got a job as a cashier at a Walmart Supercenter and I plan on working for the majority of the summer. As far as I know, my job entails working at registers for long periods of time and also being at self-checkout dealing with customers who apparently can't read the ""card only"" signs.  It's only my fourth week at Walmart but I think I've learned a lot. I mainly learned how disorganized the place can be at times and how a lot of issues can stem from customers. Every time I go into work, I finally understand the frustration many retail workers feel, and I honestly think one day I'm going to snap at my manager and quit on the spot.

I'm generally known as the ""quiet guy"", I am extremely introverted and have made very few friends at work, and don't like talking to customers much besides the occasional ""how are you today?"". Because of this, I do have an attitude to just ""do as I'm told"" and ""keep my head down and work"". But recently I've been getting very frustrated at work, and I fear I might be seen as just a pushover when I really want to avoid this.  

I'm fairly lucky compared to some workers in here, my Walmart supercenter has pretty nice supervisors and coaches, well most of them. Half the time when someone needs to get a supervisor, they are nowhere to be found, and I found those at Customer Service to be incredibly rude.  

Like any retail store- there will be co-workers and managers who are just an absolute pain to deal with and treat you horribly. I've noticed customers also have a tendency to act like the minimum-wage front-end workers are in charge of how the store is run, and will commonly complain to me. I usually find myself apologizing to the customers, and while many may say this is the correct thing to do- I feel I may be in situations in the future where I shouldn't really be apologetic and should rather stand my ground. This goes the same for management, who rarely actually seems to give breaks and will commonly have my register be the only one open during evening shifts (where lines can get extremely long)- despite there being 7 other front-end workers (on the clock) just socializing at self-checkout.

I guess Walmart is gonna force me to grow some balls and stand up to myself at times. But due to my inexperience with interacting with customers, when are some certain scenarios where I should really stand my ground? Is there a scenario where it actually is okay to ""snap"" at management and just walk out?",walmart,"How do I ""stand my ground"" against rude customers and management?",https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/o69d7z/how_do_i_stand_my_ground_against_rude_customers/

I switched to Walmart from another retail job to do overnight stocking, which I had never done before. My friend works at this Walmart, but during work, we are coworkers, not friends. A manager had previously talked to her for talking too much (before I started) and she stopped and busted her butt to get work done and this manager keeps talking about her behind her back and being rude to her and critical for no reason. No other managers have a problem with her. She has talked to multiple leaders, nothing happens.

Then, I started yesterday. I got no direction, such as, ""Do (XYZ) but not telling me what to do after or where to meet them. Telling me after I was working on a pallet myself (having just assigned a couple other people) to have it done in 5 minutes. Then telling me I didn't finish my training (I did the due ones up until July 10th. No one told me how many to do.) 

After, I looked for her and asked someone who had a walkie if they could see where she was. They walked away. I asked others if they had anything I could do, but no one answered. Finally I saw my friend, who was in an aisle by herself (next to one with 6 people, pop water juice) and asked if she knew where the leader was because I had no idea what to do. She (with the ok of someone else) showed me how to bin.

The leader saw me, told me to work with someone without telling me who it was. Then got mad at her for training me since she's new (a month or so) but she's never gotten talked to for helping anyone else. Plus, the manager blows me off, doesn't finish her sentences, snaps, and is just.. yeah. The manager has been like this to my friend the entire month. I hadn't been around her last night at all besides that. 

When my friend told another leader, she said she was just ""excited about her job and her tone is excitement.""

I wouldn‚Äôt want to leave for more than a week because I have two months (at most) left to work. For personal reasons, I can‚Äôt quit and find another job (doing this wouldn‚Äôt help anyways). 

I don‚Äôt want to look bad to my employers. I know that this should be the least of my concerns, but I want to stay on their good side (because as previously stated, I want to keep this job).

411,Uranusspinssideways,1624349431.0,o5hv27,2,6,"TL;DR at end of post.

So, a couple years ago I stumbled across this hilarious diy game called Walmart Bingo!

Has anyone else heard of it? 

For context, I'm the type who loves to go out and do completely random shit just to laugh. I'm normally pretty fun, and this game was right up my alley.

So, the basic outline of the game is similar to regular bingo mixed with a kind of scavenger hunt.

I made my own cards, and they're gridded just like normal bingo cards- except in the squares you write things like ""child unattended and screaming"", ""man in a crop top"", ""woman with chin hair"", ""obese person in inappropriate spandex"", ""cold food product in random clothing aisle"", ""elderly woman with obscene cleavage revealing outfit"" or ""person dressed in cosplay outfit""... Basically the most ridiculous things you can imagine seeing at a Walmart. 

So each person that's playing gets their own WMB card, and they mark off the things they find until someone gets a bingo. You can split up, it works better that way, but I imagine there's a plethora of ways you could go about playing this. 

So, one day I just made a bunch of extra cards (my boyfriend refuses to play with me) and put them in ziplock bags and left them around the store and parking lot with instructions... Don't know what happened with them, although that would be an interesting story that I'd love to hear lol.

*(On a side note, I've done that with really funny but inappropriate jokes in casinos and bars, before, too... I never find out what happens but I know I leave cracking up anyway. And people usually find it pretty hilarious when I tell them what I did, and what the jokes were.)*


Anyway, *has anyone ever heard of this?* You can look it up online, but I think this is totally worthy of picking up some popularity and I just wanted to share. :)

Thanks for reading! Hope y'all enjoy! If you do decide to play, come back with an update! ;)

TL;DR:
Google ""*Walmart Bingo*"" and play it with some friends, then come back and tell us about it :) :)

I asked my coach about it, she told me she‚Äôd look into it, etc‚Ä¶got back with me about it the next day and told me that somehow either the HR lady didn‚Äôt enter something into the computer correctly, or there was some other kind of unknown glitch, but basically it still had me in the system as a temporary/part time employee and not full time.

So apparently to fix the problem, both my coach and the HR lady told me they would send some kind of ticket in to home office or whatever, that way I could get the PTO/PPTO hours I should‚Äôve been getting when they had made me full time way back in January. 

However, since then, I have not seen or heard anything about my hours‚Ä¶at least once a week since then, I‚Äôll remind the HR lady about it and ask her if she‚Äôs heard anything back yet, but everytime I ask she just gives me the same runaround answer and tells me she‚Äôll look into it and get back with me.

I'm currently in the process of being coached because I was one of the people that touched the product that went missing. Basically this is an SFS issue where somebody picked a high dollar item and I was supposed to pack it. I packed everything they gave me. But apparently one item didn't get packed.  I'm getting a coaching for creating poor customer service because a customer didn't get their item. I believe that they are writing both of us up just to cover their asses on the missing item and say they did something. I haven't been able to confirm with the other person yet as they have not been on the schedule.

I have spoken to Both my team leader and Assistant manager explaining that if they know it was my fault and then they have to document how it happened. Not just that it happened. The fact is they don't know where in the process the item went missing. I know for a fact I didn't steal it, I'm not incompetent, nor negligent and so on.

My assistant has said that they will put this on hold while he researches it further. Today was supposed to be the final day of the research time but apparently they need more time.

So finally my question is . . . what happens if I refuse to sign the documentation? Are there consequences. Does anyone know where to look this up in the wire?

584,sims4ccfindz,1624240437.0,o4kcqx,22,4,">Hi. This is my first post so forgive me if I'm doing anything wrong. I recently started a job at a walmart I've worked at in the past and they're under new management. I take spironolactone which causes me to become dehydrated faster than most people. The two water fountains in the store are turned off due to covid and we're not provided cups (there's a faucet in the breakroom but no cups) or water bottles. On the days I've pushed carts, I've asked where I can get water from and I've been told by TL's and management that I need to buy a water. The $00.50 water bottles are only at the fuel station which is across the parking lot so I'm now dropping around $2.50 each day on the ones we have inside.   
>  
>I've started reusing my same water bottle and when I go home on lunch I can fill it up (I live right down the street from the store). Today I was standing near the front (coming back from lunch, still ON lunch) looking for the water bottle I had put behind the service desk so I could go out to my car. I was approached by a manager who use to be an associate under me when I last worked at this store. She went off on me, telling me we weren't allowed to have water bottles on the floor and told me to collect everyone's water bottles (there were around 4 behind the service desk) and take them to the break room.  
>  
>First I tried telling her I was on lunch but she just kept talking over me. Next I asked if she was serious and when we were suppose to get a drink of water and she said our 15 minute breaks or on lunch. I reminded her that the water fountains were turned off and we weren't being provided water in the first place but she wouldn't listen and just walked out the door (she was on her way out for the day). This is the complete opposite of what I was told in orientation just two weeks ago. My direct manager and HR both advised us all that we could keep water bottles up front as long as they were clear and just water.  
>  
>I'm waiting to get a doctors note for the dehydration since my doctor is almost four towns away and my next appointment isn't until the middle of July but now I'm not sure what to do. I'm not allowed to just walk away to the break room to take a drink of my water every ten minutes or so because we're so short staffed upfront. I didn't have a way to get water for the rest of the day since my water bottle went ""missing"" and I don't get my first check until Thursday. Any suggestions on what I can do in this situation that won't rock the boat too much?

820,Magnuscaligo,1624055004.0,o31sq6,11,0,"I know this place is mainly used by employees, and im not sure if anyone here would happen to know, but I figured I would ask just in case.

I managed to get a PS5 during the drop yesterday, but in the rush of ordering it I didn't select the fastest shipping options, meaning it won't get here for another 3 weeks.

I tried getting in contact with Walmart to see if its possible to modify the shipping options, but they said that once the order is placed there is nothing they can do.

So what I think I might try is that as soon as I get the tracking number, I will call UPS or FedEx, or whatever is used, and see if I can expedite it.

However, the package has yet to be shipped at all and says ""preparing order, tracking available soon"".

I'm worried that it's either not going to ship before the weekend, or ship during the weekend and I won't be able to contact the shipping company until Monday (meaning I might not be able to expedite because it might be too late). Or the worse possibility: It just takes walmart a week or two just to ship the package! 

I know I'm just being impatient, but im really excited and I would love to know if anyone happens to know how long it takes to ship from Walmart's perspective. Thank you.",walmart,Any idea how long to ship a package?,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/o31sq6/any_idea_how_long_to_ship_a_package/
