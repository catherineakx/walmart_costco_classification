24,WhyDoIWonderWhy,1623250952.0,nvy0lf,25,74,"I started my first week ever having a job and it's relatively easy for what I'm doing which is just overnight stocking! After about three days I was able to finish a pallet in about 70 minutes where the time should be about 60 so I think I'm doing pretty good so far! Though all they have assigned me to stock so far is paper and chem, with my first day being candy.

The only thing I don't like is zoning... not because of it but because I have to basically stand in the same place for a minute or two and move to the right or left a tiny bit, meaning I have all my weight on my feet for a long time and I have to walk a mile and a half home some mornings... if anyone knows any tips for relieving that pain I'd love to hear it!

So we go into an office and I figured they just had to check something on a computer or whatever and after like five min one was like ok have a seat and starts going over a day 20 days ago and i said ""wait am i being coached lmao???"" As ive never been coached before. 

So apparently it was because i didnt run seafood or put any meat in the bins so basically i didnt do anything for an eight hour shift. Im like okay thats BS im not gonna come in and do absolutely nothing. I said maybe it was a day with just me and one other person as we are extremely understaffed. And cap1 which one of these leads runs literally leaves 8-10 carts of produce stacked seven to eight feet tall everyday and tons of trash in meat along with at least half a pallet unprocessed and the rest of it on carts. 

So im like i dont agree with this and he said we can pull the cameras if you like. And ill admit ill take a 20 min break to smoke and shit since its so stressful here and the occasionally long shit. So i just said can i take this above you if i disagree at a later time and they said sure so i just said ill think on it and work harder if i did mess up basically. 

So today I dont have a tc 5 hours into my shift. About two hours ago im taking trash and the loss prevention or asset protection girls (2 of them) come up to me carrying a cart of cardboard to the back and say your coach(the team lead who coached me) is looking for you, said he saw you walk outside and disappear at 4 and hasnt seen you the last hour and a half. Usually he leaves at 4 and im like ok well ive been taking trash cap1 leaves everyday. Both of them were like yeah we were outside smoking with you just pop your head near him occasionally so he knows. So he had to go to them and ask them to search the cameras basically to find me which is fucking ridiculous. 

So he finds me after that trash trip and is all nice like hey what are you working on i say trash etc no tc cant do shit since i finished seafood and hes all ok and walks away.

I'm a woman and happen to work at walmart with my lover who is also another woman. She did the apparel processing while I work the floor. Tilly catches onto anything she can bite me for. She exaggerates her claims when taking me for formal chats and then tells me next time I'll be written up. I go tell her I'll be taking my 15 and she'll look at her watch and start timing me immediately whilst I'm standing there. I stopped telling her I'm taking 15s and tell fellow coworkers instead. We got an awesome new TL who is very accepting of me and my girlfriend, and she loves to chat with us and listens. We'll call her Sara. Sara makes jokes and makes sure she gets stuff done. Tilly thinks Sara is too friendly with everyone. Tilly and Sara pull everyone into the office one by one for a chat after they realized how much phone use is going on (we have 3 minors who use it often. I happen to be caught checking the time on it and Tilly points me as a problem.) The chat went okay at first, but later I regretted not recording it. As it went on, Tilly brought back up things that are months old to reprimand me on these things (she had been on vacation before this chat). Tilly would exaggerate things I did and Sara would have to occasionally correct her. Tilly made claims that I go to the backroom all the time to talk to my girlfriend simply because she can never find me on the floor. I told her I have no recollection of ever doing so. I am around in the apparel department doing my work. She claimed that she saw me and my girlfriend sitting at fitting room talking for 15 minutes. That really bugged me because that was clearly an exaggeration of this very morning. I tried to correct her because she wasn't even around for those self-proclaimed whole ""15 minutes"". I tried to tell her I was there with my girlfriend because I had a question and she answered it for me. It never lasted 15 minutes. Tilly just walked by during and that was it. When I did try to tell Tilly that, she said she was gonna call bull on that. That got me livid, but I kept calm. She then asked what I had needed help with. I told her and she called more bull because I should know how to do it. I told her my witness and said to go talk to them, they can vouch for it and she suddenly calmed down and said she believed me. I was SO confused.

I'll end it there, but it was a long chat. It wasn't the first one, but Sara was there this time. I already knew Tilly didn't like gay people so whatever. Me and my girlfriend are talking to Sara later the next day and the office chats came up. My gf mentioned to Sara that Tilly is traditional and doesn't like gay people and Sara said everything suddenly clicked together for her. She was actually distraught because she hadn't realized homophobia was the reason. Cue us being confused, then Sara told us that Tilly was completely different with all the other associates. Calm and understanding. My gf was upset by this because it shows us just how much harder Tilly is treating us because we're dating. Sara was upset as well. This happened last month in May, but since then, as of recent, I heard Tilly is switching with another TL and moving upfront. I'll also be switching departments soon hopefully.

All the front end loved me since I was great at register and especially the SCOs and was one of the few cashiers always friendly and patient with customers, so they were all surprised I got fired for something so random, even the people lead said it should‚Äôve been a warning at least. I was only working part time since I wanted a job to get out of the house since I work an online chat support job mainly.

So I resubmitted my application and called the front end coach a day or two later (Sunday) and informed them I put an application in if they need cashiers. They said great, they‚Äôll get with the store manager when they came in Monday and get back to me. This struck me as odd since I didn‚Äôt know they needed to talk with the store manager to hire people, thought it was the coach/people lead who did that. Didn‚Äôt hear anything Monday, so called Tuesday and spoke with the coach and they said they forgot and will try getting with the manager today (well, yesterday), and they‚Äôd call me back, probably not yesterday but today or tomorrow maybe, they didn‚Äôt really give a specific time when I asked. Still no call and I don‚Äôt wanna pester anyone, especially for a cashier job, but I don‚Äôt get why they‚Äôd have to speak with the manager. Even they said I could come back in two months.

Lady comes up, has her kids with her. The girls were like 5 and maybe 10-11 (pre-teen). The girls have several suits they want to try on, okay fine. The first ones they tried on were those little mermaid like suits, nope those sucked (trust me, mom was right). So back in they go, second set of suits. Older girl loved hers (some sort of orange leopard print), too big on the little one. Nope to both. Back in. 

At this point it gets interesting. The younger one tried the rest of hers on, one at a time, none fit per mom. Younger girl is okay with that and comes out to wait. 

The older girl - oh no, she wanted that second suit. So she tries on the third one, nope, comes back out in the second suit. Mom"" No, I already said no."" Rinse and repeat for the next two suits. Every other time she came out she had on that second suit. After the fourth time, Mom calls dad, puts him on Facetime (because of course pre-teen is going to come out in HER suit) and is ready. 

Girl comes out, Dad's on Facetime, makes her turn around, and says the same thing. ""NO!"" 

Finally she gives up, gets back into what she wore into the store and come out with the suit she could not have. 

While she was doing that, I had 3 other people come up, try on what they had and left. I had time to browse the wire while waiting for her to get done. Also, little brother is autistic, so Mom (who I swear had the patience of the saints) was keeping him entertained the entire time.

Maine passed a law banning single-use plastic bags. It was supposed to take effect in April of last year, but was delayed due to the pandemic. 

Connecticut has also enacted a single-use plastic bag ban that has been set to take place on July 1st since 2019. Their law required a 10 cent fee on all single-use plastic bags until July 1st, 2021 when they would no longer allow single-use plastic bags. 

Maine and Connecticut are the only states currently making this change. No other areas will see changes to the bag offerings in their stores at this time.

State health inspector was my location yesterday. I didn't know they were from the state (cause I didn't look at their badges lol.)until my team lead pointed it out. He didn't know at first either because his shift started after they had got there. Anyways I told I thought it was odd they didn't know about the black labels for the hot case. I had explained why we did have any in there (old ones accidentally got messed up) However new ones had came in but I did know that. Anyways I was asked about cleaning the slicers. It was the state health inspector, a person in training, the two bakery/deli team leads and the co-manger all there while I spur out the answer.

To the people who zone and those who so curbside shopping. You are awesome. Because of this community I put stuff back where I find things.

Little story yesterday  I went  to my local Walmart for a monitor and a stapler. Most monitors were out but the one I wanted the least bc of the price was in. I went to look for the stapler but got distracted by the notebooks as usual ,found an updated planner. ( I am trying to stay on schedule but most of the time ,I fall on it and the planner expires on me ) so I look for its family so I can see the price, nowhere to be found not even a similar cousin. So I used the app scanner thingy to get the price which I did get but the app also told me the item I was holding in my hand was out of stock. 

I still work in service so I still get the mean customers and others stuff but now I feel your pain when it comes to zoning and misinformation about stock.

But my coach told me that I am actually allowed to work any shift that works for me as I am part time and in college- making me a flex employee. I am a Hardlines TA (was crafts but they took that away) 
So I turned in my new availability a month ago and finally today they tell me it had been denied because ‚Äúmy shift doesn‚Äôt happen during that time‚Äù (I think I had it as 8-3) and ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt work nights during the summer.‚Äù Even tho I explained I am taking 3 summer classes and need the time in the evenings to study and work with my classmates and be able to get off early enough to do that. 
In addition, my team lead is having another person be moved to days as well in hopes of having both a day team and evening team and the SM approved for that. 


I guess I am just wondering who here is lying to me. My coach who said I am allowed to work days, or my SM and PL who say I can‚Äôt.

My store is understaffed, overworked and led down a path of sheer mediocrity. 

Our store manager is incompetent, all but three team leads are absolute imbeciles. (One is just temporary.)

And workplace morale is nonexistent.

We were told:

""You're the backbone of our store.""

And in the same breath just a few seconds seconds later:

""You're easily replaceable.""

By someone who's not even our overnight manager.

Everyone who's a manager is someone the Store Manager personally likes or saved from firing by bringing them to our store. As a result, we're hilariously understaffed and thus overworked.


We barely have enough people for our dairy or frozen sections and we barely get two people in there to throw a 1600 piece truck. Several coworkers said they had been told to throw 50+ boxes an hour or they will be coached for productivity. That people are begging for our jobs and the only reason they're not here doing amazing work that we're seemingly incapable of doing is because of management's sheer benevolence and mercy upon us, to allow us to work and provide for ourselves and families.


Our overnight shift has 2 TLs and only 1 is worth a shit at all. If it wasn't for him, everything would fall apart.

Our overnight  Coach is absolutely worthless. She's barely there and when she is there, she does nothing. Literally.

This is no exaggeration.

New people are barely hired and immediately  put in grocery and only want to do grocery and nothing else, they complain about being cold and perform extremely  poor when outside of grocery or zoning. 

Or they just quit.


We're also throwing the whole store and whatever mess CAP2 leaves us to do. Which is usually something unreasonable as they only scan pick carts, they don't put them out. Everyday CAP2 is sitting inside the breakroom at 9:20/9:30 and the isles are a mess and I've seen frozen and dairy pallets even blocking the entrance because they couldn't be bothered to move pallets 10 feet further.  I've seen top stock carts with open food and snack wrappers all over them just in the isle. I've seen them  turned over in aisles and customers walking around them as 2nd shift just relaxes in the breakroom or talking by end CAPs, free to do whatever now that the backbone of the store is here to clean up whatever mess they've created.

If I'm a clown for working here, then this store must be a whole fucking circus.

He literally only unloaded one side of the trailer; reasoning that getting the truck ""done"" only required the belt to reach the front of the trailer.

386,Helltech,1623024677.0,ntzdt6,20,9,"So I guess I have some questions, I'm looking more for REASONS, I truly want to understand how it works.

After something is picked if it is truly still overstock you need to print a new vizpick label? Some say yes, some say no. Why? Why some stores saying one and some saying the other and what exactly does it change in the process if you do or don't. I guess it is still picking for topstock and out topstock is always 100 percent full, so this is a common problem for us.

Vizpick label gets screwed up in the printing process somehow. It is torn up, lost, what ever. You need to print another label. Some say you just print another. Same say that screws up counts and you have to print the EXACT label. Sure I know you can print the exact label again, but how do you know the number for that label? Especially if a different person doing it at a different time? Manger 1 prints a Vizpick label. Somehow the label doesn't get on the box. Manger 2 takes over an hour or so later for what ever reason, comes across the same overstock box and prints a label for the box. What breaks down in the process if you just print a new label?

Coinciding with the previous question. What happens if someone just prints like 4 Vizpick lables for a box but they were only supposed to print 1. They don't know what they are doing, are untrained, maybe hooked up to the wrong printer (I've seen this happen before). After 36 hours those 3 extra ""cases"" that were printed will add to the salesfloor count erroneously, do I have that correct? 

What happens if things are just grabbed out of bins. Most common scenario - team associate is asked by customer to grab something in the backroom. So they do, they don't vizpick they just grab it.",walmart,VizPick training,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/ntzdt6/vizpick_training/

The main problem is just how rude they are. Almost every day we have stories to tell of how the driver had been extremely rude and cold to our associates.

Another main problem is just stupidity. Drivers picking up GM deliveries constantly park in our designated pick up spots, taking up space. And we've also had drivers give the wrong orders to people in the case of batch orders.

But a problem that just BAFFLES me every time is when a driver just doesn't deliver groceries. Either through sheer stupidity or brazen theft.

There are two types of kiosks. One allows you to get your 4 x 6 prints right then and there. The other sends the information to our side of the counter where we print the photos out and which can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour depending on how busy we are. The instant photos cost 29 cents each while the one hour photos are 9 cents apiece. Do 100 photos and that is a $20 difference in cost.

We often try to let our customers know about this when they pay for their order so maybe they can save some money the next time. Unfortunately, our good deed sometimes falls flat as the customer, 100% being women, immediately start to whine that no one told them this when they were doing the photos and that a manager needs to take care of them.

OK, Karen, here's the deal. Fuji changed the software so now there is a page with two large boxes clearly showing the prices and time involved. And you ***cannot*** go to the next page without marking one of the boxes. Showing the person this, and in the nicest way possible, only infuriates the women.

426,JadedAndFaded_,1622966376.0,ntgoa1,17,28,"When I was 16 I got employed by Walmart as a cashier. I worked there for about 6 months and quit right as I went to finish my sophomore year, and I hated the job so much. Scanning the items, weighing and identifying the fruits, and bagging them were fine, but it was always paying for it that usually was the issue. There was always some unique issue the customer has that I don't know how to fix like EBT and debating the prices of items, so I have to get a manager, which backs up the line, pisses people off, etc

When I quit, I never intended to work with Walmart again, but when I was looking for a new job after working my last job for 2+ years, I saw they had an opening for a stocker position at Walmart. Considering I had lost 110 pounds in the past year and am as active as ever, I figured a more active job would be perfect, and I was totally correct! The work is active but at the same time calm, and since you don't have to interact with many customers, you can plug one ear with an earbud and listen to music- or in my case- a podcast.

I enjoy being a stocker 100x more than being a cashier at Walmart, and thats not even considering the base $2 an hour increase in pay. Obviously being a stocker isn't perfect, but I would much rather take its shitty moments over a cashiers shitty moments.

And hats off to Walmart for the break system. The fact that I work 8 hours (scheduled 9 hours) and get an hour and 30 minutes in between work is amazing and makes time fly by.

I work all the nights (other than my days off), and so when the Ecommerce Department Manager Leaves at 230, all the department duties fall to me, and I am fine with that. Recently our orders went from 20ish a day, to 90 a day due to a covid spike. Obviously is was a big dip for us, and after the first two weeks, we finally got into a rythm. 


Anyways, I digress. The point of this post. I had a OMNI nightmare. 

I was out on the floor doing other work, and decided to go check on my team, and when I got there it was chaos. Orders were on the floor, and my team looked panicked. One of my associates. Was running out an order, but before he left he slapped a phone in my hand. I looked down and saw that three people were here and they had been waiting anywhere near 150minutes to 240 minutes. I panicked and my assistant manager on duty, and my store manager appeared outta nowhere. Me and one of my other associates got the two orders ready, and ran out to the cars with the store manager and assistant manager behind us. We got to the cars and the managers just stood there with the drivers whole my associate and I unloaded about 15 totes each. 

When we went back inside, i tried to figure out what had happened, and my managers just went back to the office. And suddenly it was the next day. I come in and go down the online grocrey room and there is a new list with names. And it said that my assistant manager was to be down here at all times underneath his name, and then what associates would be down here. And at my name, it said (exact words) just an associate. I was crushed, cause in my waking life I am trying to move up. I went home and bawled my eyes out, then I woke up from my dream.

i also remember something about how coaches can only override when people come in and under short notice (at least that's how the two stores i've worked at operated), and that other coaches cannot touch your schedule.

i work ogp & weirdly enough, about two saturdays ago, a random coach from another department decided to screw with my schedule 17 HOURS BEFORE THE START OF THAT GIVEN SHIFT.

if this isn't making any sense, i was not scheduled for a saturday, come to find out towards the end of my shift (8am-5pm) the day prior, that coach suddenly decided to schedule me for that saturday. the time it was put onto my schedule was about two hours before the end of my shift and i wasn't notified about it until an hour after my shift was over (according to the me@walmart app). i didn't actually know i was supposed to go in until a friend texted me about why i wasn't at work. 

i just want to know how any of this is okay??? they literally tell us to notify them about any schedule changes 24 hours beforehand, but random coaches we don't even know can 1) fuck with our schedules and 2) do it under that 24 hour mark?????cause now i've got to suffer with a point because of that incident. üòê

Oh, it's totally fine! You only ignore everything I suggest to make my job a little bit less miserable, knowing how unhappy I am here. I must just need to see a therapist. 

This has been going on for months. You would rather assign three guys to fuck up cosmetics on a one truck night than let me do it on my own and get it done the right way because you think I can't mentally handle it and then you tell other managers to make sure I work apparel on days when you're not there, because again, you would rather put someone with a lot of anxiety somewhere they aren't comfortable working and deal with customers who are twice as ignorant than let them work somewhere they do well and know everything because you have an agenda. 

Months ago, I agreed to process apparel on the weekend because it kept me off the salesfloor. I don't know how that translated to ""dump her in apparel by herself with little to no instruction, no scanner, and no keys so customers can call her useless all day"", but I straight up told this person two days ago apparel isn't working for me.

I've been here for nearly five years and almost every manager I've had up until the last six months has been able to work something out with me, whether it be my schedule, where I work, or who I work with. 

For example, they leave me alone in a department I find to be overwhelming but when I say I work cosmetics better by myself, they don't let me. 

Don't come and try to hunt me down after work asking me ""do you want to talk about it? ü•∫"" when you do everything you can to make sure I hate it here more than I already do, thinking I'm just going to lose my nerve every time just because you approach me with a sympathetic tone.

I have no problem with being friends with you or talking to you, but don't think you're going to manipulate me into letting you fuck me over on a daily basis. 

Yes, my personal life fucking sucks but don't use that information to invalidate how I feel as an employee. I do not need to see a shrink, I've made a few modest suggestions to make my job a little more bearable that were not only ignored but you did the polar opposite.

This manager is always feeling some way about how nobody likes them but the one associate who trusted, confided in them, and didn't judge them they screw over all the time and it's not cool.

I called them back after two days of submitting my application and they basically hired me on the spot (I had an over the phone interview) came to orientation and it all seemed ok. I was scheduled to work the next day(I was hired as OGP) without any actual training. However the manager said she didn‚Äôt have time to take me to the back room and I didn‚Äôt know where it was Bc I didn‚Äôt have a tour of the store Bc I didn‚Äôt have an actual interview, so I spent my entire first day (8 hours) behind a computer doing the CBLs. 

Next day I was thrown into the OGP back room and trained for literally 10 min, they gave me a TC, and was told good luck. It was horrible, I kept making mistakes and kept being talked to in a condescending manner (wtf do they expect I just got hired and did not get properly trained!!!). I finished the day tired as hell and I went home straight to sleep. Next day was alright but I swear workers are so rude and talk to you like you‚Äôre dumb for no fucking reason. For example, I told the asm that I was leaving for the day and she stopped me and told me that she needed to have a talk with me and told me that some other employee said I was talking too much and I was being too chatty. Bro I‚Äôm new and I‚Äôm tryna make friends or at least acquaintances. I‚Äôm sorry for talking when it is slow??? And I know who it is Bc I saw her snitch on another associate. Not to mention that they treat the back room and dispensing as if it was the Literal fucking emergency room. We had a rush yesterday and it was manageable but these associates were acting as if it was life or death if we didn‚Äôt get the orders in before 5 min.

Also, I was starting to get the hang of it and then I come in the next day and our regular asm isn‚Äôt there and everything is different. I got told that they operate differently when the asm isn‚Äôt there Bc they don‚Äôt like her system. And it makes it so hard. Under the other system it‚Äôs easy and the orders are easy to find but under the different one they don‚Äôt scan the column where the totes are and when a customer comes it‚Äôs fucking chaotic and stressful to find the tote. 

Overall, I wanted to work here Bc I wanted extra money, but it isn‚Äôt worth the extra stress. Just got done with one of the most stressful periods of my life and I don‚Äôt need anything else. 

I just have some questions regarding how to quit. I‚Äôve been told to give a 2 weeks notice so I don‚Äôt burn any bridges but honestly I cannot fathom ever working at Walmart again so I don‚Äôt really care for submitting a 2 weeks notice. How should I go about quitting? I appreciate any suggestions!

We are stuck at the mercy of the store buying their associates water bottles, but every so often our team leads and coaches won‚Äôt go get them or do the process of buying them for us.

The utter fact that the backroom has zero air conditioning is disgusting. How are we supposed to get our job as efficient as possible when we are sweating up a storm with warm water to cool us down?

But after a while, it has been a nightmare for me, one of the many reasons why I'm going to quit is the lack of hours and sometimes I would get removed from the schedule like I never existed and the constant harassment with my coach and some coworkers and the constant favorism that occurs in the back room (I work as Cap 2). The favoritism is so bad where I work that many people have quit because of it and according to what I know corporate knows and have not done anything to stop it. 

Keep in mind before making assumptions yes I have reported the altercations to HR, the Store Manager, and even the Market Manager and they still have done nothing. I even shown them evidence and it's not enough and some even shrug it off. So after two years of working at Walmart, I will finally put in my two-week notice, and to be honest, I really don't want to do it. But I had enough and the worse thing about it is that I'm in school and they don't want to work with me and ironically others who are in school who are not in Cap Team 2 have switched to better days and a better schedule. 

&#x200B;

Overall it sucks that I have to quit. But when doing it I will try and talk to the Store Manager again and see what I can do and what can change. I hope I do not have to leave. But if nothing changes then I will turn in my two-week notice.

This is where both of them screwed up. They then told me told me they know my schedule and I should be doing more to make them look good. 
Told them it was interesting that if you knew my schedule then why did you ask at the beginning of this discussion what I was doing the last 2 days?
 They both paused and one of them pulled out a vap pen and started smoking in front of me. 
Then told them if you want to make yourselves look good the start respecting your team instead of trying to set them up for your mistakes. I walked away after that and reported to eithics.

Memorial weekend just passed and my brother had to call in on that Saturday, he had 3.5 points before then and only had three hours of PTO saved up. Theres always talk about event dates, or whatever name variants, counts as two points but on the event list posted in the back it didn‚Äôt show that weekend as an event day. Not even Memorial Day itself. I get we‚Äôre supposed to be responsible for ‚Äúknowing the key dates‚Äù but I hadn‚Äôt even realized the date at all till Monday morning as I was leaving. He didn‚Äôt either. I asked my team lead the next day about what days were counted as events that weekend and he said Saturday through Monday. My brother says the points haven‚Äôt shown up yet, granted they rarely pop up within the pay period (whether that‚Äôs a system issue or a management issue that‚Äôs up for debate) and now it‚Äôs the start of a new pay period so if they do show up I don‚Äôt think he can put anything in to cover at this point. Or more so if it would cover the point. 

My main question is more so about how many points you can accumulate. I‚Äôve heard since I started there that it‚Äôs no more than 5, but I‚Äôve known many who have gone above that without getting terminated, at least not from attendance. My brother has worked there for almost 3 years, never had any issues with management or been coached, never a warning about job quality or attendance from management, but he‚Äôs gotten pretty close a few times with point from calling in. He‚Äôs a bit anxious about it now since he didn‚Äôt know it was an even day and he doesn‚Äôt know what could be done. 

Is this enough for potential termination? Could he simply be given a warning about attendance and be on thin ice? Or is it more up to management discretion how to move forward? Maybe it‚Äôs just at my store but you never seem to be able to get a straight answer about jack from any higher ups and winging it only gets so far.",walmart,Point accumulation on event date,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/nsw2tz/point_accumulation_on_event_date/

During the second meeting they suggested I transfer to another department despite us being severely understaffed. They never once said they were coaching me or had me sign anything. Both times they came to the conclusion that I need to be trained- or so I thought, but who knows what they're thinking.

I was wondering if this counted as coaching? Does coaching lead to termination? Should I transfer to another department to avoid termination?",walmart,What is coaching exactly?,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/nsnjha/what_is_coaching_exactly/

Hi fellas, I had an accident at walmart yesterday at 4:48 AM or so, I work overnights (ON TA Stocking) I started April 13. I was stocking grocery on the pasta aisle, facing the top stock cart and I fell back and hit my head/neck and back with all the shelves behind me and blackout/passed out (lol), when I regain conscioness I was in the floor and I co-worker that passed by saw me on the floor and asked if I was fine, I said ""yes, Im alright"" but the the rest of the night/morning I felt horrible, pain and really, really irritable (cuz of the pain) I was rushing to finish on time, and even acted out of frustration, like I spaped , then my team lead asked me what was going on, I finally vented my rant/pain/fustration, u see I told him when I fell, and after that, a little while, I went to unload cartboard into the bailer and he asked me how everything was going on the floor, I told him everything just flowing as usual, and told him my incident and he asked me if that was gonna happen every night, that we have to be aware of time/ pallets all this bs we already know and since we're short-staffed (""wondering why!!"") and that's when I flipped/snapped! So I kept working but really, really agressively, trowing shit up, stoking shit, you know, fast but with a feeling of ""fnck this life sucking mofo!!"" and then on break, I was like siting down and just venting/ranting on my own, ppl asked me what was going on, I told em, but I was like boiling water ( I never get this way). Anyways at the end of my shift (by 7 AM) I talk to my TL and told him everything and we go and start a accident/incident claim ( of course he didn't know the fnck to do it) so he went and ask the personnel lady (she knew but shw could care/give a fnck about it) so she told him to ask one of the more experienced team leads on the mornings, so he did and we went and did the process, took like 45 mins. Then the nurse sugested me to called 911, cuz I passed out while working when I hit my head/neck/back and I told her that I could just drive to the ER, which I did, they made a CT of my head, everything is okay, but they didn't do shit for my back pain, no x-rays, no- blood work, they gave me a work comps note for my employer to comply with the ER diagnosis and prognosis and a day off (lol! I fncking day, like I was alright!) so I just went to my GP and they gave me a no work until MD release, so I went back to walmart and asked the Store Coach/manager ( one of them) about my claim number and stuff, he said personnel lady is on the back, (she wasn't) then the coach was over there in their silly office eating or whatever and he gave me walmart cmi or whatever is called (this happened before I went to my gp). So my gp told me that until we figure out why I keep fainting/blacking out while at work (even walking lol!), like run some tests, I should not go back to work. So I went back to walmart, and the coach/manager told me as long as I am dealing with cmi/segweck and this injury/accident/incident, I should just call-in, and let em know whenever I get cmi/segweck or whatever worked out. So today later (actually on monday) on the day I will call cmi and see what's going on, also I will go monday to walmart if today or tomorrow the personell lady is not there, then may be a team lead (one that I am under their management) is there and give em a copy of my ER stay and my gp note, and ask for my claim # and his phone number to have it handy and tell em to take me out of the schedule until further notice.

So basically am asking what is the next step(s) from now on? I called in for first time yesterday because of the nature of my circunstances/inciddent/accident. So what's going to happen now, what do I do to get this straight up, all I want is medical care taken care of, and some compensation of I won't be able to go back to work till I get better.

Perhaps it's because the weather is nicer, but I am betting it's because Covid mandates are lessening in a lot of the country.

Some of my greatest hits

1. Last week was getting ready to cash a check for a customer & he seriously looks at me & asks if I had a shotgun behind SD.  I am like WHAT?  Then he says so he can go crazy on people.  Again I am like WHAT!!!!!????  Then he looks at me & says well I wouldn't use it on you people (I assume he meant Walmart workers but still?)  Apparently he quit his job, but you don't joke about that kind of stuff anymore.
2. The two Karens (not sure if it was a grandma & granddaughter) that wanted to load $2,700+ on their American Express Bluebird card, but it only let me load $1999.00 & wouldn't allow me to do a second transaction.  Of course grandma gets pissed & asks why.  Well maybe you lose out on certain luxuries since the card doesn't have fees?  How do I know?  Maybe research the card before you fucking buy it.  Apparently they're trying to buy a rental house for vacation.  She asked if she could try another Walmart & I said probably not we all run on the same software.  What does she do she leaves & then comes back & asks to take the money off the card.  Well the Bluebird card doesn't allow it so she goes ballistic.  Then she said she would buy something & then return it for cash.  Well it would go back on the card which again she doesn't like.  So then for around 10-15 minutes I get to hear them bitching at the poor person over the phone that works for Bluebird.
3. The customer who came up to me at SD to bitch that we have the dividers on deodorant to stop shoplifters!  Oh no!  How dare we try to keep products on the shelf so you don't have stinky armpits.  She just kept shouting that it was ridiculous.  Yeah it's ridiculous until you've watched videos of people literally wiping out shelves of products to resell.
4. I answer the phone to help out fitting room when we don't have anyone scheduled there or if I'm not busy & I had one lady I literally wanted to curse out!  I told her I was trying to get someone to answer her question & she started yelling that she wanted the store manager.  It's not my fault the entire store is working on freight or in a service area.  I even told her to order it as pickup today that way she could have it for sure since the website said it was in stock.  She then tells me she's a nurse & that she shouldn't get out of the website she was using for work.  Well maybe don't call when you're on THE FUCKING CLOCK!  Does the phone still say to not call because associates are busy stocking?  I wish we could enforce that.  Her life & death question was about a fucking household appliance.  Makes me wonder if people call into her health area if she treats them as disrespectfully as she treated me.
5. People trying to return stuff they've had for 2-3+ years.  I had someone try to return a Christmas sweater they bought in 2019!  Sorry we're not a pawn shop & this is not Let's Make A Deal.  Now if someone still has a receipt that is a few years old for something like curtains that is still in our system then I'll return it without a receipt & give store credit & explain why, but if it's for clothing or electronics then that's a big fat NO!
6. A lady trying to pick up money today & she had all the info wrote down.  Usually that's one clue that they don't know who they're picking up money from or even when sending.  I asked if she knew them & she said just barely.  I was like huh?  She started screaming & ran out of the store.
7. I have a long line at SD & I look out in the vestibule from the desk & see a middle aged man shaking his bag full of coins at me.  I said do you need help?  He said yeah!  Ok but I can't help you do you see my long line?  Luckily someone got a manager to go out there.

I've heard that a level 1 leave has to be approved by the store, is this true? If it is, is there any way to appeal a denial? (I'm sure it will be denied, long story, but people lead doesn't like me.) The policy on onewalmart just says to file through MySedgewick and call out until approved.

I think a lot of associates just print a backroom label and say it doesn't fit, but then the next day I will see it pick again and I'm trying to somewhat place a dent in that. I feel the on hands need to be changed too but I can't really get a good explanation.

777,NotAniel,1622779969.0,nrw9um,3,2,"Some background: I'm one of the few who front-end associates at my store that's on the 2-11 shift and closes every night. I've been doing this for several months and one of the first things I've learned is that it cannot be closed until all customers are out of the building. Typically this means I'm at least 10 minutes over every night, sometimes a bit more. My record so far is 33 minutes over.

&#x200B;

Leading up to Teaming, I was given a call from a coach asking if I wanted to opt in. They explained that I would be guaranteed 40 hours a week without any hour cuts. Ever since it's gone into effect I've only been scheduled for a single 40 hour week, which happened to be the first week of the new system. All weeks since then have been 39 hours. I can only figure their reasoning is that staying over to close means I'll end up with about 40 hours any given week. My pay usually does include a very slight amount of overtime.

&#x200B;

Mainly what I wanted to ask about is if it's right that I'm only being scheduled for 39 hours? It doesn't seem right to me that I'm effectively having an hour cut to avoid overtime. It'd be more reasonable to either be paid overtime or be allowed to leave when I'm scheduled to leave, I'd think. But this is that place after all.

unpaid days towards the end of June, the sixth day ending on July the first. It was approved a couple of days later, and I thought that was that and I've been going in to work and living my regular day to day life since.

Our manager is also scheduled to go on vacation right around the same time as me and said people without enough PTO would be running into some issues.

So I start getting out on my own every single day because they know I‚Äôll get it done no matter what. So I start not caring. They don‚Äôt come to check on me and I don‚Äôt want to kill myself doing extra work. So I start putting things where they don‚Äôt belong and throwing overstock onto the top stock. They are none the wiser. Actually tell me I am one of the best stockers there. So then by about 2 months I decide I really don‚Äôt care but I‚Äôm gonna help my coworkers out. I tell them to do the same stuff I do. Stuff starts getting done faster but every once in a while I hear a ‚Äúdamn it who put that there‚Äù from a manager. Now most of the people I do work with don‚Äôt care either and out things in random spots if they don‚Äôt know where they go. They throw overstock on the top stock in the box and in the wrong spots.

SO, I went to extend my LOA two nights before it expired, and changed the return to work date to the new date (June 13th). That gives me time for my family member to come home and the week I'm to take care of them and ensure they can be left alone. As I went to do this, a day passed and suddenly I noticed I was on the schedule again. I'm assuming they just didn't see that I had extended this leave and I was reactivated.

Put some damn clothes on.  You don't go anywhere else outside with your pajamas on, why the hell is Walmart (the place you are most likely to run into someone you know) any different?  If your 'sitting around the house hot pants' are being devoured by your fat ass, random strangers do not want to see it.

Stop picking up shit and dropping it anywhere.  You are the reason the store looks trashy.  No reasonable human being shops like this anywhere else.  And also, when you take something from frozen, and don't put it back in frozen - you might as well have spiked it on the floor like a football.  It's trash now.  You raise the price of everything else in the store when you ruin food you gormless oafs.

The shopping cart corral is right the fuck over there.  Look up. You see it?  That's where carts go.  Are you so fucking lazy that 10 feet of walking is just too much?  Of course you are.

Shoplifting applies to all products you and your child consume.  Popcorn chicken is not a free snack.  I hope they fucking choke on it.
