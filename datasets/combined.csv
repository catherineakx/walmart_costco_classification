After about three days I was able to finish a pallet in about 70 minutes where the time should be about 60 so I think I'm doing pretty good so far! Though all they have assigned me to stock so far is paper and chem, with my first day being candy.

The only thing I don't like is zoning... not because of it but because I have to basically stand in the same place for a minute or two and move to the right or left a tiny bit, meaning I have all my weight on my feet for a long time and I have to walk a mile and a half home some mornings... if anyone knows any tips for relieving that pain I'd love to hear it!

So we go into an office and I figured they just had to check something on a computer or whatever and after like five min one was like ok have a seat and starts going over a day 20 days ago and i said ""wait am i being coached lmao???"" As ive never been coached before. 

So apparently it was because i didnt run seafood or put any meat in the bins so basically i didnt do anything for an eight hour shift. Im like okay thats BS im not gonna come in and do absolutely nothing. I said maybe it was a day with just me and one other person as we are extremely understaffed. And cap1 which one of these leads runs literally leaves 8-10 carts of produce stacked seven to eight feet tall everyday and tons of trash in meat along with at least half a pallet unprocessed and the rest of it on carts. 

So im like i dont agree with this and he said we can pull the cameras if you like. And ill admit ill take a 20 min break to smoke and shit since its so stressful here and the occasionally long shit. So i just said can i take this above you if i disagree at a later time and they said sure so i just said ill think on it and work harder if i did mess up basically. 

So today I dont have a tc 5 hours into my shift. About two hours ago im taking trash and the loss prevention or asset protection girls (2 of them) come up to me carrying a cart of cardboard to the back and say your coach(the team lead who coached me) is looking for you, said he saw you walk outside and disappear at 4 and hasnt seen you the last hour and a half. Usually he leaves at 4 and im like ok well ive been taking trash cap1 leaves everyday. Both of them were like yeah we were outside smoking with you just pop your head near him occasionally so he knows. So he had to go to them and ask them to search the cameras basically to find me which is fucking ridiculous. 

So he finds me after that trash trip and is all nice like hey what are you working on i say trash etc no tc cant do shit since i finished seafood and hes all ok and walks away.

I'm a woman and happen to work at walmart with my lover who is also another woman. She did the apparel processing while I work the floor. Tilly catches onto anything she can bite me for. She exaggerates her claims when taking me for formal chats and then tells me next time I'll be written up. I go tell her I'll be taking my 15 and she'll look at her watch and start timing me immediately whilst I'm standing there. I stopped telling her I'm taking 15s and tell fellow coworkers instead. We got an awesome new TL who is very accepting of me and my girlfriend, and she loves to chat with us and listens. We'll call her Sara. Sara makes jokes and makes sure she gets stuff done. Tilly thinks Sara is too friendly with everyone. Tilly and Sara pull everyone into the office one by one for a chat after they realized how much phone use is going on (we have 3 minors who use it often. I happen to be caught checking the time on it and Tilly points me as a problem.) The chat went okay at first, but later I regretted not recording it. As it went on, Tilly brought back up things that are months old to reprimand me on these things (she had been on vacation before this chat). Tilly would exaggerate things I did and Sara would have to occasionally correct her. Tilly made claims that I go to the backroom all the time to talk to my girlfriend simply because she can never find me on the floor. I told her I have no recollection of ever doing so. I am around in the apparel department doing my work. She claimed that she saw me and my girlfriend sitting at fitting room talking for 15 minutes. That really bugged me because that was clearly an exaggeration of this very morning. I tried to correct her because she wasn't even around for those self-proclaimed whole ""15 minutes"". I tried to tell her I was there with my girlfriend because I had a question and she answered it for me. It never lasted 15 minutes. Tilly just walked by during and that was it. When I did try to tell Tilly that, she said she was gonna call bull on that. That got me livid, but I kept calm. She then asked what I had needed help with. I told her and she called more bull because I should know how to do it. I told her my witness and said to go talk to them, they can vouch for it and she suddenly calmed down and said she believed me. I was SO confused.

I'll end it there, but it was a long chat. It wasn't the first one, but Sara was there this time. I already knew Tilly didn't like gay people so whatever. Me and my girlfriend are talking to Sara later the next day and the office chats came up. My gf mentioned to Sara that Tilly is traditional and doesn't like gay people and Sara said everything suddenly clicked together for her. She was actually distraught because she hadn't realized homophobia was the reason. Cue us being confused, then Sara told us that Tilly was completely different with all the other associates. Calm and understanding. My gf was upset by this because it shows us just how much harder Tilly is treating us because we're dating. Sara was upset as well. This happened last month in May, but since then, as of recent, I heard Tilly is switching with another TL and moving upfront. I'll also be switching departments soon hopefully.

All the front end loved me since I was great at register and especially the SCOs and was one of the few cashiers always friendly and patient with customers, so they were all surprised I got fired for something so random, even the people lead said it should‚Äôve been a warning at least. I was only working part time since I wanted a job to get out of the house since I work an online chat support job mainly. The store manager wouldn‚Äôt really open door it and just said I was rehire-able in two months, and the front end coach and even the assistant manager who was there who terminated me who really likes me and my work ethic said they‚Äôd take me back.


Anyway, it‚Äôs been two months now, and I strangely do miss working there to interact with new people, and the people I worked with were really cool and I got along great with them. Even the front end team leads who I see a lot say they want me back and that I should put my application in. So I resubmitted my application and called the front end coach a day or two later (Sunday) and informed them I put an application in if they need cashiers. They said great, they‚Äôll get with the store manager when they came in Monday and get back to me. This struck me as odd since I didn‚Äôt know they needed to talk with the store manager to hire people, thought it was the coach/people lead who did that. Didn‚Äôt hear anything Monday, so called Tuesday and spoke with the coach and they said they forgot and will try getting with the manager today (well, yesterday), and they‚Äôd call me back, probably not yesterday but today or tomorrow maybe, they didn‚Äôt really give a specific time when I asked. Still no call and I don‚Äôt wanna pester anyone, especially for a cashier job, but I don‚Äôt get why they‚Äôd have to speak with the manager. Even they said I could come back in two months.

Lady comes up, has her kids with her. The girls were like 5 and maybe 10-11 (pre-teen). The girls have several suits they want to try on, okay fine. The first ones they tried on were those little mermaid like suits, nope those sucked (trust me, mom was right). So back in they go, second set of suits. Older girl loved hers (some sort of orange leopard print), too big on the little one. Nope to both. Back in. 

At this point it gets interesting. The younger one tried the rest of hers on, one at a time, none fit per mom. Younger girl is okay with that and comes out to wait. 

The older girl - oh no, she wanted that second suit. So she tries on the third one, nope, comes back out in the second suit. Mom"" No, I already said no."" Rinse and repeat for the next two suits. Every other time she came out she had on that second suit. After the fourth time, Mom calls dad, puts him on Facetime (because of course pre-teen is going to come out in HER suit) and is ready.

Maine passed a law banning single-use plastic bags. It was supposed to take effect in April of last year, but was delayed due to the pandemic. 

Connecticut has also enacted a single-use plastic bag ban that has been set to take place on July 1st since 2019. Their law required a 10 cent fee on all single-use plastic bags until July 1st, 2021 when they would no longer allow single-use plastic bags. 

Maine and Connecticut are the only states currently making this change. No other areas will see changes to the bag offerings in their stores at this time.

State health inspector was my location yesterday. I didn't know they were from the state (cause I didn't look at their badges lol.)until my team lead pointed it out.

I had explained why we did have any in there (old ones accidentally got messed up) However new ones had came in but I did know that. Anyways I was asked about cleaning the slicers.

To the people who zone and those who so curbside shopping. You are awesome. Because of this community I put stuff back where I find things.

Little story yesterday  I went  to my local Walmart for a monitor and a stapler. Most monitors were out but the one I wanted the least bc of the price was in. I went to look for the stapler but got distracted by the notebooks as usual ,found an updated planner. ( I am trying to stay on schedule but most of the time ,I fall on it and the planner expires on me ) so I look for its family so I can see the price, nowhere to be found not even a similar cousin. So I used the app scanner thingy to get the price which I did get but the app also told me the item I was holding in my hand was out of stock. 

I still work in service so I still get the mean customers and others stuff but now I feel your pain when it comes to zoning and misinformation about stock.

My store is understaffed, overworked and led down a path of sheer mediocrity. 

Our store manager is incompetent, all but three team leads are absolute imbeciles. (One is just temporary.)

And workplace morale is nonexistent.

We were told:

""You're the backbone of our store.""

And in the same breath just a few seconds seconds later:

""You're easily replaceable.""

By someone who's not even our overnight manager.

Everyone who's a manager is someone the Store Manager personally likes or saved from firing by bringing them to our store. As a result, we're hilariously understaffed and thus overworked.


We barely have enough people for our dairy or frozen sections and we barely get two people in there to throw a 1600 piece truck. Several coworkers said they had been told to throw 50+ boxes an hour or they will be coached for productivity. That people are begging for our jobs and the only reason they're not here doing amazing work that we're seemingly incapable of doing is because of management's sheer benevolence and mercy upon us, to allow us to work and provide for ourselves and families.


Our overnight shift has 2 TLs and only 1 is worth a shit at all. If it wasn't for him, everything would fall apart.

Our overnight  Coach is absolutely worthless. She's barely there and when she is there, she does nothing. Literally.

This is no exaggeration.

New people are barely hired and immediately  put in grocery and only want to do grocery and nothing else, they complain about being cold and perform extremely  poor when outside of grocery or zoning. 

Or they just quit.


We're also throwing the whole store and whatever mess CAP2 leaves us to do. Which is usually something unreasonable as they only scan pick carts, they don't put them out. Everyday CAP2 is sitting inside the breakroom at 9:20/9:30 and the isles are a mess and I've seen frozen and dairy pallets even blocking the entrance because they couldn't be bothered to move pallets 10 feet further.  I've seen top stock carts with open food and snack wrappers all over them just in the isle. I've seen them  turned over in aisles and customers walking around them as 2nd shift just relaxes in the breakroom or talking by end CAPs, free to do whatever now that the backbone of the store is here to clean up whatever mess they've created.

If I'm a clown for working here, then this store must be a whole fucking circus.

He literally only unloaded one side of the trailer; reasoning that getting the truck ""done"" only required the belt to reach the front of the trailer. There was still freight to the ceiling on half of the vehicle! This manager finished in time to strutt out of the trailer just as my associates were arriving for their 2PM shift. He points at the trailer, declares that he just unloaded 2700 cases in less than two hours, and strolled straight over to SM's office (presumably to brag).

I had to hold my tounge until he was gone. I brought my asocates into the trailer and explained that they should never unload this way.

386,Helltech,2021-06-07 08:11:17,ntzdt6,20,9,"So I guess I have some questions, I'm looking more for REASONS, I truly want to understand how it works.

After something is picked if it is truly still overstock you need to print a new vizpick label? Some say yes, some say no. Why? Why some stores saying one and some saying the other and what exactly does it change in the process if you do or don't. I guess it is still picking for topstock and out topstock is always 100 percent full, so this is a common problem for us.

Vizpick label gets screwed up in the printing process somehow. It is torn up, lost, what ever. You need to print another label. Some say you just print another. Same say that screws up counts and you have to print the EXACT label. Sure I know you can print the exact label again, but how do you know the number for that label? Especially if a different person doing it at a different time? Manger 1 prints a Vizpick label. Somehow the label doesn't get on the box. Manger 2 takes over an hour or so later for what ever reason, comes across the same overstock box and prints a label for the box. What breaks down in the process if you just print a new label?

Coinciding with the previous question. What happens if someone just prints like 4 Vizpick lables for a box but they were only supposed to print 1. They don't know what they are doing, are untrained, maybe hooked up to the wrong printer (I've seen this happen before). After 36 hours those 3 extra ""cases"" that were printed will add to the salesfloor count erroneously, do I have that correct? 

What happens if things are just grabbed out of bins. Most common scenario - team associate is asked by customer to grab something in the backroom. So they do, they don't vizpick they just grab it.",walmart,VizPick training,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/ntzdt6/vizpick_training/,16,2

The main problem is just how rude they are. Almost every day we have stories to tell of how the driver had been extremely rude and cold to our associates.

Another main problem is just stupidity. Drivers picking up GM deliveries constantly park in our designated pick up spots, taking up space. And we've also had drivers give the wrong orders to people in the case of batch orders.

But a problem that just BAFFLES me every time is when a driver just doesn't deliver groceries. Either through sheer stupidity or brazen theft.

There are two types of kiosks. One allows you to get your 4 x 6 prints right then and there. The other sends the information to our side of the counter where we print the photos out and which can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour depending on how busy we are. The instant photos cost 29 cents each while the one hour photos are 9 cents apiece. Do 100 photos and that is a $20 difference in cost.

We often try to let our customers know about this when they pay for their order so maybe they can save some money the next time. Unfortunately, our good deed sometimes falls flat as the customer, 100% being women, immediately start to whine that no one told them this when they were doing the photos and that a manager needs to take care of them.

OK, Karen, here's the deal. Fuji changed the software so now there is a page with two large boxes clearly showing the prices and time involved. And you ***cannot*** go to the next page without marking one of the boxes. Showing the person this, and in the nicest way possible, only infuriates the women.

i work closing though and when it got to be really late at night it wasnt that bad, it was just me and another worker there and he was pretty helpful and showed me how to close up, but what really turned me off of working here even more was seeing him get straight up bullied by other coworkers. after that he opened up to me about how it's making him want to switch jobs, the associates are meaner than the customers. i have pretty bad anxiety and i was hoping working would get me more used to people but now im scared of mean customers AND associates...

I worked there for about 6 months and quit right as I went to finish my sophomore year, and I hated the job so much. Scanning the items, weighing and identifying the fruits, and bagging them were fine, but it was always paying for it that usually was the issue. There was always some unique issue the customer has that I don't know how to fix like EBT and debating the prices of items, so I have to get a manager, which backs up the line, pisses people off, etc

When I quit, I never intended to work with Walmart again, but when I was looking for a new job after working my last job for 2+ years, I saw they had an opening for a stocker position at Walmart. Considering I had lost 110 pounds in the past year and am as active as ever, I figured a more active job would be perfect, and I was totally correct! The work is active but at the same time calm, and since you don't have to interact with many customers, you can plug one ear with an earbud and listen to music- or in my case- a podcast.

I enjoy being a stocker 100x more than being a cashier at Walmart, and thats not even considering the base $2 an hour increase in pay. Obviously being a stocker isn't perfect, but I would much rather take its shitty moments over a cashiers shitty moments.

And hats off to Walmart for the break system. The fact that I work 8 hours (scheduled 9 hours) and get an hour and 30 minutes in between work is amazing and makes time fly by.

I work all the nights (other than my days off), and so when the Ecommerce Department Manager Leaves at 230, all the department duties fall to me, and I am fine with that. Recently our orders went from 20ish a day, to 90 a day due to a covid spike. Obviously is was a big dip for us, and after the first two weeks, we finally got into a rythm. 


Anyways, I digress. The point of this post. I had a OMNI nightmare. 

I was out on the floor doing other work, and decided to go check on my team, and when I got there it was chaos. Orders were on the floor, and my team looked panicked. One of my associates. Was running out an order, but before he left he slapped a phone in my hand. I looked down and saw that three people were here and they had been waiting anywhere near 150minutes to 240 minutes. I panicked and my assistant manager on duty, and my store manager appeared outta nowhere. Me and one of my other associates got the two orders ready, and ran out to the cars with the store manager and assistant manager behind us. We got to the cars and the managers just stood there with the drivers whole my associate and I unloaded about 15 totes each. 

When we went back inside, i tried to figure out what had happened, and my managers just went back to the office. And suddenly it was the next day. I come in and go down the online grocrey room and there is a new list with names. And it said that my assistant manager was to be down here at all times underneath his name, and then what associates would be down here. And at my name, it said (exact words) just an associate. I was crushed, cause in my waking life I am trying to move up. I went home and bawled my eyes out, then I woke up from my dream.

i also remember something about how coaches can only override when people come in and under short notice (at least that's how the two stores i've worked at operated), and that other coaches cannot touch your schedule.

i work ogp & weirdly enough, about two saturdays ago, a random coach from another department decided to screw with my schedule 17 HOURS BEFORE THE START OF THAT GIVEN SHIFT.

if this isn't making any sense, i was not scheduled for a saturday, come to find out towards the end of my shift (8am-5pm) the day prior, that coach suddenly decided to schedule me for that saturday. the time it was put onto my schedule was about two hours before the end of my shift and i wasn't notified about it until an hour after my shift was over (according to the me@walmart app). i didn't actually know i was supposed to go in until a friend texted me about why i wasn't at work. 

i just want to know how any of this is okay??? they literally tell us to notify them about any schedule changes 24 hours beforehand, but random coaches we don't even know can 1) fuck with our schedules and 2) do it under that 24 hour mark?????cause now i've got to suffer with a point because of that incident. üòê

TL;DR: why can random coaches fuck with our schedule on such short notice but we're supposed to swap a shift / ask for an override 24 hours prior ? there's gotta be some sort of violation here dude LMFAO",walmart,issues with managers messing with schedules under the 24 hour mark???,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/ntc9m8/issues_with_managers_messing_with_schedules_under/,69,11

Oh, it's totally fine! You only ignore everything I suggest to make my job a little bit less miserable, knowing how unhappy I am here. I must just need to see a therapist. 

This has been going on for months. You would rather assign three guys to fuck up cosmetics on a one truck night than let me do it on my own and get it done the right way because you think I can't mentally handle it and then you tell other managers to make sure I work apparel on days when you're not there, because again, you would rather put someone with a lot of anxiety somewhere they aren't comfortable working and deal with customers who are twice as ignorant than let them work somewhere they do well and know everything because you have an agenda. 

Months ago, I agreed to process apparel on the weekend because it kept me off the salesfloor. I don't know how that translated to ""dump her in apparel by herself with little to no instruction, no scanner, and no keys so customers can call her useless all day"", but I straight up told this person two days ago apparel isn't working for me.

I've been here for nearly five years and almost every manager I've had up until the last six months has been able to work something out with me, whether it be my schedule, where I work, or who I work with. 

For example, they leave me alone in a department I find to be overwhelming but when I say I work cosmetics better by myself, they don't let me. 

Don't come and try to hunt me down after work asking me ""do you want to talk about it? ü•∫"" when you do everything you can to make sure I hate it here more than I already do, thinking I'm just going to lose my nerve every time just because you approach me with a sympathetic tone.

I have no problem with being friends with you or talking to you, but don't think you're going to manipulate me into letting you fuck me over on a daily basis. 

Yes, my personal life fucking sucks but don't use that information to invalidate how I feel as an employee. I do not need to see a shrink, I've made a few modest suggestions to make my job a little more bearable that were not only ignored but you did the polar opposite.

This manager is always feeling some way about how nobody likes them but the one associate who trusted, confided in them, and didn't judge them they screw over all the time and it's not cool.

I called them back after two days of submitting my application and they basically hired me on the spot (I had an over the phone interview) came to orientation and it all seemed ok. I was scheduled to work the next day(I was hired as OGP) without any actual training. However the manager said she didn‚Äôt have time to take me to the back room and I didn‚Äôt know where it was Bc I didn‚Äôt have a tour of the store Bc I didn‚Äôt have an actual interview, so I spent my entire first day (8 hours) behind a computer doing the CBLs. 

Next day I was thrown into the OGP back room and trained for literally 10 min, they gave me a TC, and was told good luck. It was horrible, I kept making mistakes and kept being talked to in a condescending manner (wtf do they expect I just got hired and did not get properly trained!!!). I finished the day tired as hell and I went home straight to sleep. Next day was alright but I swear workers are so rude and talk to you like you‚Äôre dumb for no fucking reason. For example, I told the asm that I was leaving for the day and she stopped me and told me that she needed to have a talk with me and told me that some other employee said I was talking too much and I was being too chatty. Bro I‚Äôm new and I‚Äôm tryna make friends or at least acquaintances. I‚Äôm sorry for talking when it is slow??? And I know who it is Bc I saw her snitch on another associate. Not to mention that they treat the back room and dispensing as if it was the Literal fucking emergency room. We had a rush yesterday and it was manageable but these associates were acting as if it was life or death if we didn‚Äôt get the orders in before 5 min.

Also, I was starting to get the hang of it and then I come in the next day and our regular asm isn‚Äôt there and everything is different. I got told that they operate differently when the asm isn‚Äôt there Bc they don‚Äôt like her system. And it makes it so hard. Under the other system it‚Äôs easy and the orders are easy to find but under the different one they don‚Äôt scan the column where the totes are and when a customer comes it‚Äôs fucking chaotic and stressful to find the tote. 

Overall, I wanted to work here Bc I wanted extra money, but it isn‚Äôt worth the extra stress. Just got done with one of the most stressful periods of my life and I don‚Äôt need anything else. 

I just have some questions regarding how to quit. I‚Äôve been told to give a 2 weeks notice so I don‚Äôt burn any bridges but honestly I cannot fathom ever working at Walmart again so I don‚Äôt really care for submitting a 2 weeks notice.

However, my husband is a great worker and this is ridiculous. Its wearing down on him pretty hard, im pretty close to calling up hr myself and asking whats going on.

But after a while, it has been a nightmare for me, one of the many reasons why I'm going to quit is the lack of hours and sometimes I would get removed from the schedule like I never existed and the constant harassment with my coach and some coworkers and the constant favorism that occurs in the back room (I work as Cap 2). The favoritism is so bad where I work that many people have quit because of it and according to what I know corporate knows and have not done anything to stop it. 

Keep in mind before making assumptions yes I have reported the altercations to HR, the Store Manager, and even the Market Manager and they still have done nothing. I even shown them evidence and it's not enough and some even shrug it off. So after two years of working at Walmart, I will finally put in my two-week notice, and to be honest, I really don't want to do it. But I had enough and the worse thing about it is that I'm in school and they don't want to work with me and ironically others who are in school who are not in Cap Team 2 have switched to better days and a better schedule. 

&#x200B;

Overall it sucks that I have to quit. But when doing it I will try and talk to the Store Manager again and see what I can do and what can change. I hope I do not have to leave. But if nothing changes then I will turn in my two-week notice.

Karen asked what time we close. TL says 11. Karen asks if she gets in the door at 10:59 can she do her shopping and get checked out. TL said, yes if you get in before the doors closed, you will be allowed to do your shopping. 

Karen steps it up: Well, I can't make it before the doors close. Can I get there like 5 minutes later and you guys let me in so I can shop? TL: No, once the doors are closed, no other customers are allowed in. 

Karen: Well I already said I was coming. You should let me in, just because I get there a few minutes past shouldn't be that big a problem! TL: No we can't.

Is there a working download page? Where can I download the program file? When looking through my Wal-Mart account I can't find a way to check in; it says it must be done through their software.

Memorial weekend just passed and my brother had to call in on that Saturday, he had 3.5 points before then and only had three hours of PTO saved up. Theres always talk about event dates, or whatever name variants, counts as two points but on the event list posted in the back it didn‚Äôt show that weekend as an event day. Not even Memorial Day itself. I get we‚Äôre supposed to be responsible for ‚Äúknowing the key dates‚Äù but I hadn‚Äôt even realized the date at all till Monday morning as I was leaving. He didn‚Äôt either. I asked my team lead the next day about what days were counted as events that weekend and he said Saturday through Monday. My brother says the points haven‚Äôt shown up yet, granted they rarely pop up within the pay period (whether that‚Äôs a system issue or a management issue that‚Äôs up for debate) and now it‚Äôs the start of a new pay period so if they do show up I don‚Äôt think he can put anything in to cover at this point. Or more so if it would cover the point. 

My main question is more so about how many points you can accumulate. I‚Äôve heard since I started there that it‚Äôs no more than 5, but I‚Äôve known many who have gone above that without getting terminated, at least not from attendance. My brother has worked there for almost 3 years, never had any issues with management or been coached, never a warning about job quality or attendance from management, but he‚Äôs gotten pretty close a few times with point from calling in. He‚Äôs a bit anxious about it now since he didn‚Äôt know it was an even day and he doesn‚Äôt know what could be done. 

Is this enough for potential termination? Could he simply be given a warning about attendance and be on thin ice? Or is it more up to management discretion how to move forward? Maybe it‚Äôs just at my store but you never seem to be able to get a straight answer about jack from any higher ups and winging it only gets so far.",walmart,Point accumulation on event date,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/nsw2tz/point_accumulation_on_event_date/,32,5

I've been pulled into the back twice now into a private room with a team lead and another person of management. Both discussions started out as them basically saying I'm not doing my job right, but quickly turned into a discussion on how I simply haven't been trained on those tasks they had expected me to perform.

During the second meeting they suggested I transfer to another department despite us being severely understaffed. They never once said they were coaching me or had me sign anything. Both times they came to the conclusion that I need to be trained- or so I thought, but who knows what they're thinking.

Hi fellas, I had an accident at walmart yesterday at 4:48 AM or so, I work overnights (ON TA Stocking) I started April 13. I was stocking grocery on the pasta aisle, facing the top stock cart and I fell back and hit my head/neck and back with all the shelves behind me and blackout/passed out (lol), when I regain conscioness I was in the floor and I co-worker that passed by saw me on the floor and asked if I was fine, I said ""yes, Im alright"" but the the rest of the night/morning I felt horrible, pain and really, really irritable (cuz of the pain) I was rushing to finish on time, and even acted out of frustration, like I spaped , then my team lead asked me what was going on, I finally vented my rant/pain/fustration, u see I told him when I fell, and after that, a little while, I went to unload cartboard into the bailer and he asked me how everything was going on the floor, I told him everything just flowing as usual, and told him my incident and he asked me if that was gonna happen every night, that we have to be aware of time/ pallets all this bs we already know and since we're short-staffed (""wondering why!!"") and that's when I flipped/snapped! So I kept working but really, really agressively, trowing shit up, stoking shit, you know, fast but with a feeling of ""fnck this life sucking mofo!!"" and then on break, I was like siting down and just venting/ranting on my own, ppl asked me what was going on, I told em, but I was like boiling water ( I never get this way). Anyways at the end of my shift (by 7 AM) I talk to my TL and told him everything and we go and start a accident/incident claim ( of course he didn't know the fnck to do it) so he went and ask the personnel lady (she knew but shw could care/give a fnck about it) so she told him to ask one of the more experienced team leads on the mornings, so he did and we went and did the process, took like 45 mins. Then the nurse sugested me to called 911, cuz I passed out while working when I hit my head/neck/back and I told her that I could just drive to the ER, which I did, they made a CT of my head, everything is okay, but they didn't do shit for my back pain, no x-rays, no- blood work, they gave me a work comps note for my employer to comply with the ER diagnosis and prognosis and a day off (lol! I fncking day, like I was alright!) so I just went to my GP and they gave me a no work until MD release, so I went back to walmart and asked the Store Coach/manager ( one of them) about my claim number and stuff, he said personnel lady is on the back, (she wasn't) then the coach was over there in their silly office eating or whatever and he gave me walmart cmi or whatever is called (this happened before I went to my gp). So my gp told me that until we figure out why I keep fainting/blacking out while at work (even walking lol!), like run some tests, I should not go back to work. So I went back to walmart, and the coach/manager told me as long as I am dealing with cmi/segweck and this injury/accident/incident, I should just call-in, and let em know whenever I get cmi/segweck or whatever worked out. So today later (actually on monday) on the day I will call cmi and see what's going on, also I will go monday to walmart if today or tomorrow the personell lady is not there, then may be a team lead (one that I am under their management) is there and give em a copy of my ER stay and my gp note, and ask for my claim # and his phone number to have it handy and tell em to take me out of the schedule until further notice.

So basically am asking what is the next step(s) from now on? I called in for first time yesterday because of the nature of my circunstances/inciddent/accident. So what's going to happen now, what do I do to get this straight up, all I want is medical care taken care of, and some compensation of I won't be able to go back to work till I get better.

Well I still have about 20min of overtime, and they said today was the last day to get rid of overtime (so I can't just leave 20min early tomorrow). I guess because today is the last day of the pay period???

Anyway, I don't know how I even got OT. I clock in on time, clock out exactly on time, and take a full hour lunch, sometimes an hour 10min. I think they just don't want to pay me for full time.

Perhaps it's because the weather is nicer, but I am betting it's because Covid mandates are lessening in a lot of the country.

Some of my greatest hits

1. Last week was getting ready to cash a check for a customer & he seriously looks at me & asks if I had a shotgun behind SD.  I am like WHAT?  Then he says so he can go crazy on people.  Again I am like WHAT!!!!!????  Then he looks at me & says well I wouldn't use it on you people (I assume he meant Walmart workers but still?)  Apparently he quit his job, but you don't joke about that kind of stuff anymore.
2. The two Karens (not sure if it was a grandma & granddaughter) that wanted to load $2,700+ on their American Express Bluebird card, but it only let me load $1999.00 & wouldn't allow me to do a second transaction.  Of course grandma gets pissed & asks why.  Well maybe you lose out on certain luxuries since the card doesn't have fees?  How do I know?  Maybe research the card before you fucking buy it.  Apparently they're trying to buy a rental house for vacation.  She asked if she could try another Walmart & I said probably not we all run on the same software.  What does she do she leaves & then comes back & asks to take the money off the card.  Well the Bluebird card doesn't allow it so she goes ballistic.  Then she said she would buy something & then return it for cash.  Well it would go back on the card which again she doesn't like.  So then for around 10-15 minutes I get to hear them bitching at the poor person over the phone that works for Bluebird.
3. The customer who came up to me at SD to bitch that we have the dividers on deodorant to stop shoplifters!  Oh no!  How dare we try to keep products on the shelf so you don't have stinky armpits.  She just kept shouting that it was ridiculous.  Yeah it's ridiculous until you've watched videos of people literally wiping out shelves of products to resell.
4. I answer the phone to help out fitting room when we don't have anyone scheduled there or if I'm not busy & I had one lady I literally wanted to curse out!  I told her I was trying to get someone to answer her question & she started yelling that she wanted the store manager.  It's not my fault the entire store is working on freight or in a service area.  I even told her to order it as pickup today that way she could have it for sure since the website said it was in stock.  She then tells me she's a nurse & that she shouldn't get out of the website she was using for work.  Well maybe don't call when you're on THE FUCKING CLOCK!  Does the phone still say to not call because associates are busy stocking?  I wish we could enforce that.  Her life & death question was about a fucking household appliance.  Makes me wonder if people call into her health area if she treats them as disrespectfully as she treated me.
5. People trying to return stuff they've had for 2-3+ years.  I had someone try to return a Christmas sweater they bought in 2019!  Sorry we're not a pawn shop & this is not Let's Make A Deal.  Now if someone still has a receipt that is a few years old for something like curtains that is still in our system then I'll return it without a receipt & give store credit & explain why, but if it's for clothing or electronics then that's a big fat NO!
6. A lady trying to pick up money today & she had all the info wrote down.  Usually that's one clue that they don't know who they're picking up money from or even when sending.  I asked if she knew them & she said just barely.  I was like huh?  She started screaming & ran out of the store.
7. I have a long line at SD & I look out in the vestibule from the desk & see a middle aged man shaking his bag full of coins at me.  I said do you need help?  He said yeah!  Ok but I can't help you do you see my long line?  Luckily someone got a manager to go out there.

I had 1.5 hours protected time, but because I did not want to push carts, I was fired.

A little over a week later, got a new job working for humans.

Guess they are going to nix cashiers because they do not know how the real world works.

Also when I take it to the backroom and put it in the bin am I supposed to vizpick scan again without clicking on anything and then just exit to re-bin it?

I think a lot of associates just print a backroom label and say it doesn't fit, but then the next day I will see it pick again and I'm trying to somewhat place a dent in that. I feel the on hands need to be changed too but I can't really get a good explanation.

777,NotAniel,2021-06-04 12:12:49,nrw9um,3,2,"Some background: I'm one of the few who front-end associates at my store that's on the 2-11 shift and closes every night. I've been doing this for several months and one of the first things I've learned is that it cannot be closed until all customers are out of the building. Typically this means I'm at least 10 minutes over every night, sometimes a bit more. My record so far is 33 minutes over.

&#x200B;

Leading up to Teaming, I was given a call from a coach asking if I wanted to opt in. They explained that I would be guaranteed 40 hours a week without any hour cuts. Ever since it's gone into effect I've only been scheduled for a single 40 hour week, which happened to be the first week of the new system. All weeks since then have been 39 hours. I can only figure their reasoning is that staying over to close means I'll end up with about 40 hours any given week. My pay usually does include a very slight amount of overtime.

&#x200B;

Mainly what I wanted to ask about is if it's right that I'm only being scheduled for 39 hours? It doesn't seem right to me that I'm effectively having an hour cut to avoid overtime. It'd be more reasonable to either be paid overtime or be allowed to leave when I'm scheduled to leave, I'd think. But this is that place after all.

They didn't take me out of the system until a couple of weeks ago. I was just fine logging into my Merril Lynch account this morning but I went to look at how the stocks were doing this afternoon and got this message:

""there is a problem with your login attempt. Please call the Merril Lynch Retirement and Benefits Contact Center at 1 866 820 1492"".

Password was just fine so I assume they finally got the ""hit"" from WM and want me to do something with the account, there is around 30k in there.

My main question, although I have others, is... are we allowed to keep it in there and pay some sort of monthly fee? I'm at the age where I don't have to pay the penalty but would like to keep it rolling along for now with no contributions and just let the market do its thing.

Are they trying to strong arm me into calling... and what happens if I don't? Surely some sort of letter will be coming in the mail. Wait for that?

unpaid days towards the end of June, the sixth day ending on July the first. It was approved a couple of days later, and I thought that was that and I've been going in to work and living my regular day to day life since.

Tonight, a coworker of mine called to inform me that our store's inventory is being bumped up to August, rather than it's regular September-November, and that our manager said this may impact some people's vacations in the months of June through August. Our manager is also scheduled to go on vacation right around the same time as me and said people without enough PTO would be running into some issues. 

I am unsure whether this implies to me, seeing it as my vacation has been approved since literally January, and I didn't even use any PTO.

Stop picking up shit and dropping it anywhere.  You are the reason the store looks trashy.  No reasonable human being shops like this anywhere else.  And also, when you take something from frozen, and don't put it back in frozen - you might as well have spiked it on the floor like a football.  It's trash now.  You raise the price of everything else in the store when you ruin food you gormless oafs.

The shopping cart corral is right the fuck over there.  Look up. You see it?  That's where carts go.  Are you so fucking lazy that 10 feet of walking is just too much?  Of course you are.

Shoplifting applies to all products you and your child consume.  Popcorn chicken is not a free snack.  I hope they fucking choke on it.

Rami, who might be a supervisor, looked for appropriate tires and showed them to me. Then he said he'd try to get approval to mount them after hours. Well time dragged on as my son and I had difficulties finding a way to pay for the tires. **Nota Bene!** Costco  does NOT accept Master Card debit or credit cards! That was all we had between us, a couple each but all Master Cards. Also, the ATM inside the store, which Rami got us access to, doesn't work with Master Card debit cards, my son was unable to get cash. Strangely, when I later tried with my European debit card (Master Card), I was able to get cash.

So the tires were paid for and a very (extremely) patient Rami and his associate, whose name I unfortunately did not get, mounted and balanced the tires and all work was finished pretty close to 6pm. Amazing!

Of course I tried to give them a tip but they refused saying something about a fine (or did he say fired?) if they accepted. He asked me to leave a nice review instead - no problem!

I want to make sure my experience does not just stay in a survey so I am writing here some of what I wrote on the survey. This has been the worst experience I've ever had with any retailer in my life.  From the long wait, the lack of truthfulness from Costco representatives and the delivery team. 

When I initially received the W/D the stacking kit was missing. It was my fault because I was not aware I needed one since my previous W/D did not require one. The delivery team contacted the Costco rep to notify the stacking kit was missing. I was advised by the Costco rep over the phone that I should order one through Costco Online or Amazon and as soon as I receive it to notify them in order to send the delivery team for installation. I immediately logged in to Costco Online just to find out that the item was not sold separately. I decided to chat with the rep who told me to order to item from amazon and then call back. I asked her if she could wait a minute as I was placing the order at the same time we were chatting. I purchased the item and advise her. She reached out to Costco Logistics to schedule the appointment. It turned out that the Costco Logistics team stated that I would lose any warranty because the stacking kit was not purchased from Costco and the Delivery Team will not install anything that what's on the box they deliver. The Costco rep stated that my only option was to cancel my order and purchase a new W and D with the stacking kit. By them, the Delivery team had already left my house with my old washer and dryer and the new ones left in my garage. I advised the Costco rep the delivery team was gone to which she replied that they will not turn around because I accepted the delivery.

So at that moment, I found myself with no washer and dryer so I placed a new order for which I had to wait almost two months and about the same time for them to pick up the new ones left in my garage. Yes, they could not use the new ones sitting in my garage. I had to get new ones.

Once I received the new ones, the Delivery Team told me that the W and D will not fit in my laundry room. Yes, this was after I was the previous team had installed the washer from the first delivery. After going back and forth with the now disgruntled and repulsive delivery guy who even told me that he would install them but if they did not fit he was not going to take them back. Once upstairs he refused to place the W and D on top of a dripping pan to protect the home from water leaks.  At that time I was so fed up due to the entire situation that I decided it was not worth arguing with the guy. I can also continue ranting but for what.

Immediately disappointed when I opened it to find 2 small bags of cauliflower with fluid, and 2 small bags of sauce. In all, it was maybe 1/3 of a medium to large sized $2 cauliflower. I'd expected breaded/battered cauliflower - I guess I overlooked the ""paleo"" and ""keto"" buzz words on the labelling.

The instructions warn you to drain the broth from the ""sous vide"" vegetables, and once you open the package and smell it, you understand why. Even with the broth drained, the cauliflower in the finished dish was plasticky or chemical in taste.

The 2 sauce bags contained the General Tso's sauce - okay in flavor but just a plain cornstarch-based sauce.

So basically this is non-fresh produce and cornstarch sauce with a layer of cardboard packaging, a plastic tray and a lid, containing plastic-wrapped produce and sauces.

It was edible but I couldn't quite get over the strange taste in the cauliflower. I just feel suckered

The guys ended up arriving at my house unannounced... I had a bad feeling about things once that happened.  Sure enough, the guys were really rough with the tv and packaging, opened the box and seemed surprised by how thin the tv was (as if they'd never installed a new tv before), dropped the tv out of the box and damaged the corner of the screen, and moved random stuff in my house that didn't need to be moved (I just don't like it when people touch stuff without asking beforehand, as I had cleared the entire living room beforehand to make enough room for them anyway).  Needless to say it was a really bad experience.

Thankfully though, when I called costco to describe the experience, the were very nice, refunded the install fee, and will be back next week to switch the tv out with another one.  I just hope it's not the same people again because that would be really awkward.

Anyway, it seemed strange that I haven't really read bad experiences like this, but I thought I'd fill in in case someone was debating on whether or not to get the 20 dollar set up charge.

The nearest Costco is a little bit of a drive away and I can't always make it. So the new shipping options would help me order cheese, meat and snacks right to my door. Or so I thought. 

I have previously ordered using 2-day shipping, where one of my items was delivered (I kid you not) after two weeks. No harm, no foul, things happen. The other stuff that was supposed to be delivered in 2 days wasn't delivered in 2 days either. You know, not a problem‚Ä¶ it was a new feature then. 

But I recently ordered with 2-day shipping again, and it's been 2 days yesterday, and the order status still shows ""order is being prepared"". I have a feeling it won't be getting delivered before mid-week next week. 

Contrast that with the experience we have all had with Amazon. When they say ""two day delivery""‚Ä¶ they mean two day delivery. 

As retail industry has moved on and evolved, I am fearful that Costco will be left behind. I love the company and what it stands for. I love that they treat their employees much better. I was hoping Costco will set yet another standard in home delivery logistics while maintaining their reputation for treating their employees well. 

I am willing to forgive Costco a lot of things just because I'm not donating to the Bezos Empire every time I need something delivered to my house. Because this current order was delayed, won't mean I will die. But I do want the best for Costco, and I am afraid that most customers just want delivery to be held to the Amazon standard. 

To be relevant in twenty years from now, Costco has to step up its home delivery game by a big, big, big margin.

115,driven2D,2021-06-07 00:59:20,ntq7w1,12,27,"The KS Ultra Clean liquid laundry detergent was on sale so I decided to give it a shot since it had pretty good reviews.  It was a pretty bad experience for me, but YMMV.  The scent is a little strong, but the real problem is how sudsy it is, especially since I have a front load HE washer.  The suds would build in volume and not rinse away easily, unlike most HE detergents.  I reduced the dosing every time to basically a teaspoon, would use an extra rinse, but it was still very sudsy and my towels were getting stiff.  I don't have soft water either (pretty medium, San Jose CA area).

&#x200B;

Then I had 2 loads of laundry throw an error on my machine mid-wash.  I searched online and the error code means that the machine is overflowing with water (it wasn't) or there are so many suds that it's tripping the overflow sensor.  I did notice the pump seemed to be running excessively long when initiating a spin cycle.  I re-washed that load with just water, and a lot of soap came out.  Then I ran the machine clean cycle and the amount of detergent build up after \~1 month of use was incredibly bad.  I knew the detergent had to go back.  Thankfully, Costco is great with returns, and I found my interaction with the CS rep interesting:

&#x200B;

""Hi, I'd like to return this please.  It's way too sud...""

""Clogged up your machine?""

""Yup.  Clearly you must get this a lot?""

""All the time.""

&#x200B;

So, I just wanted to pass along a warning of my experience with this product.  It seemed to clean well, but it started to damage my washing machine, and apparently I'm not alone.  I switched back to Tide (which was actually way cheaper on sale at Safeway than at Costco), and everything works perfectly again.  No more suds, build up, or error codes, and my towels are softer and fluffier again.",Costco,Oversudsing with KS Ultra Clean Laundry Detergent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ntq7w1/oversudsing_with_ks_ultra_clean_laundry_detergent/,49,7

The latter seems like the best deal to me. The storage size (64GB vs 128GB) is a dealbreaker, which makes the Pro the best option here. By comparing the prices with Apple‚Äôs website, the Air is already listed at $30 less so I‚Äôm assuming the Pro has a price reduction too. I also wanna get an Apple Pencil and a case so the cost of these accessories adds up and I‚Äôm trying to fit it all into my budget.

Last week I purchased these Melona frozen bars. Price approximately $0.35/each in box of 24. They tasted OK. I looked at ingredients and discovered they were made in Korea.

That made me think about what seemed to me impossible supply chain economics.

Made/frozen/packaged in Korea then shipped to my west coast Costco. 

1. Freezer truck to airport or shipping port in Korea.

2. Frozen shipping on plane or ship. 

3. Freezer truck from US port/airport to Costco. Customs fees etc.

4. Unpacking and stocking in Store. 

5. Cost of maintaining frozen until sold.

How is this even possible at this price? Are there freezer containers on ships? Are bulk air freight for frozen goods that low?

Probably not the correct reddit to ask this question but maybe someone here has an insight how this might work. If these were made in SF or LA I could understand the economics but Korea?",Costco,Supply Chain Economics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ns7zcj/supply_chain_economics/,22,3

My love is the deli, I started in the deli, and I wanted to move up, I was told it would be easy,  just work hard and learn as much as you can.

I learned meat department, food court, front end, member services, did S.I.T, went back to the deli, and I am a merchandiser.   I have always wanted to move up in the deli, for years I put in for supervisor spots, and was told, someone with more seniority, or knowledge, always got it, and I needed to know other areas of the warehouse.  Cool, I did that!

I tried again a few years later, was told I was was not knowledgeable enough with the AS400, and reports.  So I learned what I could access. 

Tried again. 
Was told I didn't know the Lingo enough.  Like the acronyms.   Okay. I went back to my manager and begged her to teach me. My department is one of the busiest in the region.  She refused  because we are too busy and she doesn't want to waste precious time outside of me and producing because I am one of her top producers.

She bullies and verbally tears down her crew of people and everyone is so used to the terrorizing ways we just take it and kept our heads down.  

Like I want to move up so fucking bad. Yet I have been told so much I am too nice, too talkative. Too friendly.  I have been told I will never move up over and over again by my old manager. 

I tried again recently,  I feel broken and so disheartening because even after 15 years of being a sponge, working my ass off, I am never good enough.  I know I am fat. I know I am not always the fastest. I get my job done.  What the fuck does it take to move up anymore.  It seems I must need to be a total brown noser or worse. I am not buddies or friends with managers,  nor do I want to be. I stay clear of being too friendly outside of work. I have seen some absolutely atrocious people be moved up who have no clue how to manage, have horrid communication skills. And yet they are all managers. 

Costco has broken me. I love and I hate Costco, but it's all I know, and I love working in the deli.  I want to be a deli manager some day but now I know.  I will never be anything but a grunt.

Costco has destroyed any self confidence I have had in the past. I have applied for over 13 years to probably 100 different supervisor spots. Nothing.  I came close once. I used to interview well, but my old manager did a number on my head, I stumble on my words and get so nervous now. Because I fear rejection, I know I am already rejected before I even try. They always have someone picked out anyways. Interviews are usually just formalities now days.  

I have been passed up for people I have so much more knowledge and experience on, and it will come to light they have family members that are managers in other stores,, its just so damn disheartening.   I don't know why I even try anymore.  Costco has destroyed my desire to be anything better because the rejection is destroying me.  Because they just want their good grunt workers to stay down so they can be pushed to the breaking point.  

I am so damn sad, angry at myself for wasting away my life and never getting farther. I wanted to grow with this company, I wanted to teach and help people grow. I wanted to be a deli manager. I am just the fat, annoying talkative person. I want to know what will make me good enough.  Will I ever be good enough? 
I have always been told I am a good teacher, patient, kind and very knowledgeable,  but its never enough!

260,christinathestorygrl,2021-06-02 18:30:34,nqipxw,18,3,"I've had terrible luck.  I've purchased four portable ACs from Costco over the last nine years and three of them were defective, failing within 18 months, four months, and the new one I got last week had broken caster wheels and started leaking after only two days of operation.

Despite this failure rate, I've told literally dozens of people that Costco is THE only option for buying a portable AC.  If you look at reviews on Costco and other sites, all portable ACs have like a 20-30% failure rate, and the manufacturers' warranties are worthless because you have to pay hundreds of dollars in round-trip shipping to utilize them.   The Costco return policy is your only protection against getting a $500-700 lemon.  I'm so passionate about protecting my friends and coworkers from this possibility that I've done everything except grab people by their lapels to get them to order through Costco rather than Amazon et al.

Well, now I've received my third AC lemon and it has to be returned.  We're of course going to replace it with another Costco portable AC, but I am TERRIFIED that I might get my membership revoked for doing another ""big"" return.

I think I'm a good Costco member!  I've had the Costco Visa card for years and I bought my home and car insurance through Costco.  I use Costco Optical and Pharmacy.  I shop at Costco once a week for groceries and that's my only gas station.

I do maybe two or three minor returns a year for issues like a foam pillow having a strong chemical odor or a clothing item not fitting.  Never anything stupidly abusive like returning a dead Christmas tree or a rotisserie chicken carcass or an 8 year old printer.

But returning a third portable AC unit freaks me out!  Does this seem like too much? Should I preemptively talk to a supervisor or the store manager?  Does anyone have any insight into what might trigger Costco to cancel your membership?

EDIT TO ADD:  

Well, my boyfriend and I returned the AC to the warehouse and the returns person said her own AC, also purchased at Costco, broke after a year!  So she was pretty sympathetic. When I told her I was afraid of getting kicked out of Costco, she said, ""no way, this is fine.""

I just booked my first ever Costco travel flight/hotel for some of my friends and I to go to Vegas and stay at the Luxor the second week of July. We booked it back around mid-April. I'm wondering how the hotel aspect works. I was looking through my email and found a confirmation # for the hotel- but it does not work on the Luxor website. Is that just because it is booked through Costco? My fear is our hotel doesn't get booked and we show up without anywhere to stay. üò≠

Costco makes almost all profits on membership dues.  Sales minus costs and admin (salaries) wipes out all sales essentially.  

Membership renewal rate is almost 90%, very strong

Same store sales have continued to grow, at 16% increase

TIL Costco has their own chicken farm and two beef farms to supply their meat products

Costco opened their first store in China last year.  While they have stores in Taiwan, Korea and Japan already.

This first store in China is their largest and after one year produced 400,000 memberships!  It's in Shanghai, one of the largest cities but still! 

They have 2 more Chinese stores under construction in China.

I watched a video of the CEO walking through the store showcasing how great the low prices were.  The host asked if they could make more by raising the prices and the CEO laughed so hard!  ""That's not us!""

Costco's Mission:

""Here at Costco, we have a very straightforward, but important mission: to continually provide our members with quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices.""

Costco stock pays a dividend, but occasionally they will pay an extra dividend to reward investors!  Yes, their great service extends to shareholders too!

Costco stock has increased 24% int he past year and 165% over the past 5 years.

YET, on the 21st I saw a large purchase that would have been sense using the Costco Citi promotion and applied for a card on Costco's website at the checkout screen. This is important. After being approved I realized I only received an email for the last 4 digits of the card. Couldn't sign up on Citi's website with that info, but amazingly if I wanted to renew my Costco card (that was due in a few days...) I could see the card's last 4 on Costco's website, so OBVIOUSLY there was some form of communication between Costco and Citi, even if I couldn't use the card to renew (or check out)

Called Costco that following Saturday after going into the store to inquire about how to pay for this large item. Got a temp card to renew my stuff, but the temp card doesn't work online. Gotta call Citi. Called Citi. Was told I have to wait for the physical card in the mail - no way to expedite. NO WAY TO EXPEDITE?!?!? So at this point I've likely pulled a hard credit to get a CC that I can't use. No virtual cards and no way for Citi to help me pay for what was on Costco's site.

Now, I almost focused my hate exclusively on Citi as they issued the card...BUT COSTCO ADVERTISES SIGNING UP FOR THE DAMN CARD WHEN CHECKING OUT!!!! Imagine if you were about to drop $4k on something on Amazon and they were like ""hey, sign up for our CC....thank you. You're approved! Now wait 7-10 business days for the actual card to come in the mail before purchasing. But don't worry, we'll send hourly reminders that you have items in your shopping cart!!!!!""

Last Weds I got a notice in the mail...that my card was on its way. Full of promotional crap that had no bearing on me. Naturally my large purchase went Out of Stock the day the promotion ended and now I have a CC that I couldn't use. I'll wait for a 4th of July sale or whatnot just so I can exercise the warranty feature, but if that wasn't the case I'd use my Discover card, get that 5% back for warehouse purchases online, and dip. 

Costco: You shouldn't try to pimp a card at the checkout screen if folks can't use it ASAP. Citi, you shouldn't act like you can't expedite a card for first-time issues. If it was a replacement I could have allegedly had it FedEx, which blew my mind. Furthermore I read on a forum that if you claimed you were doing international travel that may trigger the release; I shouldn't have to lie to get a card to use!

I told him exactly what I wanted- 12 mini in red, case, trade in, pay in full and transfer my stuff. He said no problem and we started. First, they had no red or symmetry case. Fine, just get it done. He sent me to pay but they only took $50 for tax. He explained I couldn't return it if I paid in full and to NOT pay Verizon until I was sure I would keep. Sure, ok. AFTER I was an hour spent into the process he warns me he probably won't be able to transfer my stuff. I was furious. I calmly explained this was his #1 selling point against Verizon in the first minute of his speal and it was unenthical to disparage them for something he couldn't do anyway. Blah, blah, blah. He said (all puffed up and bullish) he was sorry I was upset and did I want to finish. I was 90 minutes in and my old phone wasn't working so I said fine. At the end I asked about my trade in and he said I had to do it with Verizon! WHAT?

I called Verizon when I got home and he lied about the pay in full and return policy and he signed me up for a 2 year contract, which I have not for 10 year.

I truly cannot believe Costco would allow a business like that to operate in their stores. Shameful!

P.S. Per the comments- the issue is he outright lied about several things and signed me up for a contract that I did not consent to. It was NEVER EVEN MENTIONED and I did not sign anything...and yes, I have transferred my stuff from icloud before. i was looking to have it all done at once but acknowledge the convenience probably doesn't trump security. :-) Verizon will make it right but this was fraudulent. I have posted all on social media, messaging Costco and BBB as well. Posted reviews, etc. If anyone has other ideas to make people aware and stop this, please let me know.

I took time off of work to receive my items between 8AM-10AM. The delivery never occurred and I called Costco back. Their response was, ""one of your two items was not received. We can't deliver your items"" Then why would Costco/Innovel email and call me twice that my items would be delivered. I call back the following day to reschedule the delivery for the following week on 5/28.

On the second attempt for the delivery on 5/28, I was again emailed and called that my items would be delivered, this time between 10AM-12PM. Guess what, that was a lie, the items never arrived. I called Costco/Innovel customer service and I was told to call them back after a 1.5 hour grace period occurred, a leeway window for ""late"" deliveries. I waited and no appliances. I called back again and was transferred this time directly to Innovel's direct customer line. I waited an hour, no luck getting help. I hung up and called Costco/Innovel back to report the poor experience and missing two days of work for phantom deliveries. Now I'm told I have to wait until 9PM for the hopes the appliances arrive.

The complete lack of training, braindead management, rampant nepotism, sexual harassment, revolving door of employees, and fickle safety procedures are just a few of my concerns. Our warehouse manager asking Covid-positive employees who didnt show symptoms to still work their shifts is yet another concern.
Being screwed out of my Covid bonus as a part timer who works full time hours is, again, yet another concern.

When I started, I really gave it my all, but it slowly faded, starting with when they promoted a man in the warehouse who was well known to sexually harass every female coworker in the store, all because he was cozy with management, not because he was even remotely close to fulfilling his job description.

The only reason I‚Äôve stayed at all is to transfer out of state then immediately look for something else after moving. I‚Äôve been sending out transfer requests and job bank applications left and right since the start of this year, and can‚Äôt seem to secure anything or get any opportunity to leave my warehouse. I‚Äôve put in for almost 40 jobs, interviewed for about half of those applications. Nothing.

Look, I‚Äôm remaining cautiously hopeful that this is just my current store, not the company as a whole. I would love to transfer to see if an older more established warehouse has it‚Äôs shit at least somewhat together. But what now? I‚Äôm in great standing, near perfect attendance, perfect reviews, and even letters of recommendation, but I get nothing but transfer denials, rejection letters, or just complete radio silence on any job transfer I apply to.

Is it even worth trying to transfer with this company? Because my mental health means much more to me than Jelinek‚Äôs stock going up a quarter of a percent.

Hi, I have been a member since the Price Club days. I have always told people they should buy TVs from Costco because they are a no hassle return/repair/replace store. I said this having never returned anything before. I used the concierge system once and was directed how to reset my TV which solved my issue back then. Last year I bought a TCL 50"" from Costco, and it worked great. Thirteen months later, the TV failed by displaying only vertical purple and black bars. I have gone through at least 7 - 10 calls over the past month. They could never get through to service dispatch. I was told multiple times that I would be called by them in 24-48 business hours. In frustration, I took the TV to the store where I was informed that they couldn't take the TV back or help me in any way without authorization. I called concierge services again and went through the usual pattern of waiting while they tried to reach someone in service. After yet another 30-45 minute call, I was given the number to call service myself. Late last week I was finally able to get a call through to service dispatch. I was given instructions how to take 4 pictures and email them in. I did this. I still didn't hear anything. I resized the pictures in case the files were too large and resent them. several days later still nothing so I called again. I was told that the pictures didn't clearly show all four corners of the TV, but I had trimmed the photos down to just the TV to make the file smaller. I was informed that I need to take all of the pictures again and resubmit. them wait 2-3 business days before checking back. They will not reach out, you must continually call them. So, I guess I am venting because I will likely not have resolution until next month, at least after Monday. Is this typical? I'm really disappointed with this process, given the reputation that Costco enjoys. My first return in over 30 years isn't impressing me.

Forward, a year later, a different Costco.  I push the lower octane button and notice the higher octane, higher price button, which I did not push lit up.  I pumped fuel and took a receipt.   The receipt confirmed the premium fuel charge.    
A $3 price difference for fuel purchased. This time I noticed a fuel truck filling an underground tank while I was pumping.   This may be a coincidence.

I have a question regarding orientation day!
When have yall hear back about the orientation day after getting hired?

I did my interview about 2 weeks ago I heard back from my manager that I got hired. She explained the terms over the phone and told me to wait to hear back about the orientation date. 

I am in Canada and the department I have applied for is pharmacy. Keeping in mind that my availability starts from June 1st (due to my school and the manager was fully aware of it), it has been 2 weeks since she hired me and I still haven't heard back about my orientation date. I did contact the manager last week and she said she is still waiting to hear back as well. So I am starting to get worried. Like I haven't signed any document or whatsoever. 

Is it normal to take this long to hear back about orientation? Or did I get laid off before I even had my orientation üòÖüòÇ?",Costco,Costco orientation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/nkjxf9/costco_orientation/,18,2

I called customer service and the only thing I was told was appliances are taking longer to be delivered right now so it probably wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. I was hoping to get a more concrete answer than that.

Firstly I was hired as an AM stocker which is a nice change of pace from my old job. But anyways, I tried searching for the answers on this subreddit and google but I just couldn't find them. Anyways...

*  So tomorrow is my first 8 hour shift. From what I've read, I can't work more than 5 hours straight without a lunch I think? Also when I do go on lunch, do I have to tell anyone or is that kind of like my 15 minute breaks?

* So it seems like to me stocking kind of ""ends"" when the store opens. Was curious about who I should go to next to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing? It seems like from what I've read, front end work is pushing carts, cashier assistant and working the snack bar. I'm also wondering if I'll be trained on those things or if it's a ""trial by fire"" kind of thing.

* Finally, I think one of the women who work HR told me if I'm going from AM stocking to like ""open store hours"" work that I can't wear a t-shirt and cargo shorts. So I'm wondering if that means like polo and khakis or something similar? Any clarification would be great.

I got a pair of clear 1.67 glasses and a pair of sunglasses in polycarbonate. To make a long story short, the sunglasses in poly worked fine but I could not focus on the 1.67 pair. The optician checked the Rx and offered to remake them in a different frame. Same issue.

Since 2014, I've purchased another pair of sunglasses in the poly material and again, I have zero issues (I love the polarization and mirror finish!). Well, I'm in need of another pair of sunglasses, and I'm told that you no longer offer polycarbonate lenses -- that you recently switched manufacturers. Is that correct?

So there's a few questions raised in my experience. Why do you think that your 1.67 lens material didn't work for me all those years ago? Something to do with the physics? And lastly, now that you've changed manufacturers, do you think I will run into the same issue again? Is the manufacturer who makes the 1.67 lens also making the 1.6 as well? (In which case I won't be able to use you for sunglasses anymore). Or the manufacturer completely different now?

Anyhoo, last week my sibling alerted me of an unadvertised sale at Costco, $5 off for the above Charmin TP!  I went on Friday afternoon and the shelf was empty and the price sign indicated that the sale will end today with a limit of 2.

Undeterred, I returned on Saturday morning at around 915AM and was stunned to see the parking lot more than half full.  And I thought I was the early bird.  I expected to see some Charmin because I speculated Costco would restock it at the beginning of the day.  Sadly, I was wrong and the shelf was empty again.  When I asked the clerk when he expected another shipment, he said he didn't know and suggested I call and check tomorrow.  Then he removed the sign displaying the product and the discounted price.  That's not good.

On Sunday afternoon, I drove to the woods for a long walk. Since Costco is between the woods and my home, I decided to stop by on a hunch on the way home.  I was surprised I was able to find a parking spot given the time of the day.  Then I made a beeline to the same spot and was delighted to see four columns of TP about 7 feet high.

I realized the system is defective because it reboots every several minutes. After chatting with an incompetent tech support person I was told I would need to send it to them for inspection/repair.

I could return the item to costco for a replacement for sure but one problem I have is with the promotion I relied on. The product page last month indicated if I pay for it with the Costco Citi card I'd get back $250. This type of promotion was on a lot of product pages. I just can't find the conditions now though. Does anyone know what I am referring to and have a link to some description maybe?

If I return the item for replacement I am worried it may mess up the promo and make it seem like I returned the original item and bought it back again in May.  If that were the case I may bite the bullet and deal with Swann RMA process. The after-'rebate' cost may be OK for this system but list price is a bit much.

I'm going to leave out the product name so as not to expose ""member pricing"" on anything in particular... but I suspect anybody with a membership can figure out which specific item I'm referring to. ;)

There is currently a TV on sale at my local warehouse for $2699, and it includes a ""$200 rebate"" in the form of a Costco Cash card.

That pricing is good through 5/18. Starting 5/19, the same TV goes down to $2199 (it is in in the local flyer/mailer that has pricing starting 5/19 and good through 6/20 or something, which is how I know what the new price will be).

I'm sure you can guess where I'm going with this... 
If I were to buy it now at $2699, I'm pretty sure they would allow an adjustment to the new price on Wednesday (I've done this before with a different item in the past).

But would Costco tell me I have to return (or pay back) the $200 gift card? If I can't keep the gift card, I'll just wait for the price to drop before buying. ;)",Costco,"Price adjustment when item originally included a ""rebate"" via Costco Cash card?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/netyql/price_adjustment_when_item_originally_included_a/,79,12

819,NookinFutz,2021-05-15 21:00:44,ncyd9h,21,39,"We've been looking for almost a year for LVP flooring that's waterproof to replace the older laminate in our home.  We needed approximately 1700 square feet, every location except the bathrooms, needed new flooring.

We shopped all of the local and national home-improvement stores, and when we saw that Costco was selling Mohawk, we called / emailed and asked for floor samples.

We compared those samples sent with the quality and prices being asked by the home-improvement stores and one local flooring store, and decided based upon the quality and the return / guarantee of Costco that we would pull the plug and purchase.

We waited until it went back on sale at $39.99 per box, placed our order, watched our sales savings show up, and then realized that the shipping fee of $250 from other stores was also included.  

We just had it installed (finally!) after waiting almost two months for our installer to put us on the schedule.  He was impressed with the quality, asked me about the pricing -- and when I told him that the price included the shipping from the factory he was impressed.

We could NOT be happier with this choice, with the service / shipping from Costco to Mohawk and even the return services of the unused boxes.

If you are thinking about upgrading one of your rooms and/or your house and considering LVP, do consider Costco.  Read what others are saying on the reviews, and watch for the sales.  Right now, all of the previous eight options of this flooring are sold out on the website.

The reviewers said not to purchase the transition pieces because the coloring was off, so we simply took a sample to our local flooring store and purchased enough for our transition into our bathrooms and laundry room.  

The reviewers warned about rocking chairs, office chairs, etc. and to use mats, even though this flooring is 'scratch proof.'

The one bad thing that we kinda realized as they were pulling up the older flooring is that this flooring is thinner, so all of our baseboards will need to be touched up and repainted.

And one of the bigger tips we read / learned was to order 15% more, watch for batch numbers, etc.  A lot of the reviews said that the shipping was horrible, and I think instead of sending the flooring via freight, they were shipping it via UPS / Fed Ex -- and the boxes were damaged.  Since ours was a larger order, it was shipped and delivered via freight and contained on pallets.  We had not one broken box in the delivery.

While many complained that the board width was not consistent, that problem must have been fixed, as each box that was opened and reviewed was the same width, had no cracks, and we only had one board that wasn't finished properly.

With a household of dogs, sand, water, soon-to-be returning visitors, we couldn't be happier with our savings and quality.

My only wish is that Costco / Mohawk would recommend local installers.  We choose the professional installers as we needed their expertise to remove all of the previous room transitions installed.  Our flooring is now seamless, no more tripping over that stupid transition.  Reviews on the website said that many homeowners installed this themselves for additional savings.

Fast forward to the latest order. A microwave. Delivery and install scheduled for the same day, Wednesday. Take off work. Delivery team drops out off. No call no show from the install team. Call Northstar who says a supervisor will call me. No call back from a supervisor.

Call them Thursday morning. They have clue what happened but reschedule me for today 1pm-5pm. It's 440pm my time and I've heard nothing from the installer. Tried calling north star again. They have no voice mail or call hold so I usually end up calling for about an hour until I'm lucky enough for someone to pick up.

1 Opener (Works 5:00-10:00 or 5:00-1:30) 

1 Manager (Usually works 7:00-3:30)

1 Supervisor (Usually works 7:00-3:30)

7 Preppers (Works around the 6:00-4:30 mark. Hours vary)

1 Mid-day shifter (Works like 12:00-5:00 or something)

1 Closer AKA me (Either 1:30-10:00 or 3:30-10:00 on weekdays and 11:30-8:00 on weekends)

Our store isn't that busy. We have 3 rotisserie ovens and two combi ovens. I'm not sure exactly how much we do in sales, but to put it in perspective, I pretty much always will do 30 chickens every hour on weekdays or 60 every hour on weekends. The preppers, manager, and sup really just prepare the entrees all day. Don't really help with cleaning much (I've come in to a mountain of dishes a few times and trash-liners filled to the brim). Mid day shifter usually helps with prep and does misc. prep work like chopping shredded chicken/peppers. On a good day, they get all dishes done/trash taken out.

Then there's me. As soon as I come in, I'm solely responsible for 

1) Making sure rotisserie chickens are always stocked

2) Making sure the cooked ribs/drumsticks are always stocked

3) Harvesting chicken/ribs

4) Basic closing duties (cleaning ovens, floors, oil caddies, etc)

I usually finish around 9:15 on weekdays and 7:00 on weekends. Front end always ends up needing my help though and I've honestly just started using personal time to clock out early.

I mean, time definitely flies but damn does it burn you out, especially working that 11:30-8:00 shift on Saturdays.

Feels like I have exhausted all my options to no avail. But firstly want to say I have been a executive member for almost 3 years now and got the Citi card and love it. 

 

 It all started 3 months back. I saw that I had only accumulated $4.15 for the last 10 months. My Citi card had $85+. So I went to the customer service counter and they couldn't explain it at all. They did some looking around and found out we had spent about $4500 in the last 10 months.  Then asked me a few questions. ""Did you buy a lot of gas?"" no, covid working from home. ""Have you been returning a lot of items?"" nope. The folks behind the counter talked within themselves for a few minutes asking each other questions, gave up, took my number told me they will reach out to their manager and get back to me. 2 weeks passed nothing.

&#x200B;

So I went in again, this time some other person was there. He asked the same questions. Again took my number and said he would call. I asked if I could get some kind of a service request/ ticket number he said no. It has been 6 weeks, haven't heard anything.

&#x200B;

While I was waiting I also called the customer service number. Told them what happened, same questions. They said they will do an investigation. Again I asked if I could get a ticket/service request number. They said no but they also said they will update my account profile and would receive an email. Haven't received anything not even a email confirmation.
