Recently we caught and banned a user who worked for a supplier who was pretending to be a member who ""finally found a product"". If it wasn't for a keen eye of a user here pointing out they mentioned working for them in a previous post, it would have looked like a legitimate post.

We will never ban these types of posts as it undermines everything this subreddit is for. However, we would like to remind you to take these posts at an arm's length.

For awhile now, the Mod Team at r/Costco has desired to implement some ‚Äúback of house‚Äù updates and quality of life improvements to the sub. Life has a way of getting in the way though. 

I was very much taken aback by u/alwaysthenoob‚Äôs [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/nqo4ih/friendly_reminder_your_i_love_this_product_posts/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from last week and was impressed by the overall response it received. It hit me that it was time to make some much needed change. 

I‚Äôd like to welcome u/CookiebutterLovers as our newest moderator. They will be assuming the role of administration duties for r/Costco and will include enhancing post quality, rule updates, improvements to Automod and overall feel of the subreddit to deal with our recent growth. 

I hope your take away from this post is that you feel heard. We truly do care about this subreddit and want to see it continue to grow, improve and foster a strong community. We appreciate and respect all forms of constructive criticism; last week was a reminder to not remain idle!

Have a wonderful day!",Costco,Please Welcome Our New Moderator!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/nujg54/please_welcome_our_new_moderator/

No apologies, no offer of compensation, no solutions - just passing from one company or dept. to another. I told them to cancel and come get the broken one - they refused! I had to threaten a chargeback and throwing the damn thing into the street before they would magically organise the pickup. They also double charged me 200 dollars for another order they said they'd cancelled but didn't.

Total time wasted: 5+ hours on hold and talking to people that just have a script and never deviate. Even the managers.

Order now in with Lowes because I can go see it and confirm stock in the store.

Edit: just to clarify, Costco delivered and installed the broken dishwasher in April. The whole thing has been comically bad and not even so much as a 'have a free hotdog' or something for the hours of wasted time. So, that's four failed attempts to get a dishwasher installed and working and their best answer today was to simply reorder it and send me to the back of the queue.

12,dontlookovermysholdr,1623280916.0,nw98u8,5,13,"I'm going to leave out a lot of details about how I got into this fix but I needed new tires for my trailer wheels. I had no idea I'd wind up at a Costco at 5pm on a Sunday evening as they were closing the Tire Center.

Rami, who might be a supervisor, looked for appropriate tires and showed them to me. Then he said he'd try to get approval to mount them after hours. Well time dragged on as my son and I had difficulties finding a way to pay for the tires. **Nota Bene!** Costco  does NOT accept Master Card debit or credit cards! That was all we had between us, a couple each but all Master Cards. Also, the ATM inside the store, which Rami got us access to, doesn't work with Master Card debit cards, my son was unable to get cash. Strangely, when I later tried with my European debit card (Master Card), I was able to get cash.

So the tires were paid for and a very (extremely) patient Rami and his associate, whose name I unfortunately did not get, mounted and balanced the tires and all work was finished pretty close to 6pm. Amazing!

Of course I tried to give them a tip but they refused saying something about a fine (or did he say fired?) if they accepted. He asked me to leave a nice review instead - no problem!

16,Far-Pizza-6939,1623272375.0,nw67cw,8,14,"I purchased a washer and dryer....

I recently received an email from Costco requesting feedback from my experience. I want to make sure my experience does not just stay in a survey so I am writing here some of what I wrote on the survey. This has been the worst experience I've ever had with any retailer in my life.  From the long wait, the lack of truthfulness from Costco representatives and the delivery team. 

When I initially received the W/D the stacking kit was missing. It was my fault because I was not aware I needed one since my previous W/D did not require one. The delivery team contacted the Costco rep to notify the stacking kit was missing. I was advised by the Costco rep over the phone that I should order one through Costco Online or Amazon and as soon as I receive it to notify them in order to send the delivery team for installation. I immediately logged in to Costco Online just to find out that the item was not sold separately. I decided to chat with the rep who told me to order to item from amazon and then call back. I asked her if she could wait a minute as I was placing the order at the same time we were chatting. I purchased the item and advise her. She reached out to Costco Logistics to schedule the appointment. It turned out that the Costco Logistics team stated that I would lose any warranty because the stacking kit was not purchased from Costco and the Delivery Team will not install anything that what's on the box they deliver. The Costco rep stated that my only option was to cancel my order and purchase a new W and D with the stacking kit. By them, the Delivery team had already left my house with my old washer and dryer and the new ones left in my garage. I advised the Costco rep the delivery team was gone to which she replied that they will not turn around because I accepted the delivery.

So at that moment, I found myself with no washer and dryer so I placed a new order for which I had to wait almost two months and about the same time for them to pick up the new ones left in my garage. Yes, they could not use the new ones sitting in my garage. I had to get new ones.

Once I received the new ones, the Delivery Team told me that the W and D will not fit in my laundry room. Yes, this was after I was the previous team had installed the washer from the first delivery. After going back and forth with the now disgruntled and repulsive delivery guy who even told me that he would install them but if they did not fit he was not going to take them back. Once upstairs he refused to place the W and D on top of a dripping pan to protect the home from water leaks.  At that time I was so fed up due to the entire situation that I decided it was not worth arguing with the guy. I can also continue ranting but for what.

49,post_vernacular,1623258240.0,nw0sqs,8,1,"About a month or so ago I noticed something terrifying. My Costco peanut butter smelled and kinda tasted rancid. 

* YES i always refrigerate it after opening it, immediately after stirring it
* IMO it's the best peanut butter out there, it's perfect
* HUGE peanut butter fan, eat it constantly
* I DID open another jar, just to check it it was that one, but same result :(
* Testing by other people has been inconclusive. I have at least 1 person saying it's all in my head, and another saying no, it does smell strange. 

I'm wondering if there was a bad batch? I have a third unopened jar that I'm willing to open, but I'm honestly afraid it will also smell/taste rancid. 

It's not un-eatable, but it does smell and taste different. I did catch COVID a while back (October) and have wondered if that affected my taste buds? But the timing is off, and no other foods have been affected.

Immediately disappointed when I opened it to find 2 small bags of cauliflower with fluid, and 2 small bags of sauce. In all, it was maybe 1/3 of a medium to large sized $2 cauliflower. I'd expected breaded/battered cauliflower - I guess I overlooked the ""paleo"" and ""keto"" buzz words on the labelling.

The instructions warn you to drain the broth from the ""sous vide"" vegetables, and once you open the package and smell it, you understand why. Even with the broth drained, the cauliflower in the finished dish was plasticky or chemical in taste.

The 2 sauce bags contained the General Tso's sauce - okay in flavor but just a plain cornstarch-based sauce.

So basically this is non-fresh produce and cornstarch sauce with a layer of cardboard packaging, a plastic tray and a lid, containing plastic-wrapped produce and sauces.

It was edible but I couldn't quite get over the strange taste in the cauliflower. I just feel suckered

The guys ended up arriving at my house unannounced... I had a bad feeling about things once that happened.  Sure enough, the guys were really rough with the tv and packaging, opened the box and seemed surprised by how thin the tv was (as if they'd never installed a new tv before), dropped the tv out of the box and damaged the corner of the screen, and moved random stuff in my house that didn't need to be moved (I just don't like it when people touch stuff without asking beforehand, as I had cleared the entire living room beforehand to make enough room for them anyway).  Needless to say it was a really bad experience.

Thankfully though, when I called costco to describe the experience, the were very nice, refunded the install fee, and will be back next week to switch the tv out with another one.  I just hope it's not the same people again because that would be really awkward.

Anyway, it seemed strange that I haven't really read bad experiences like this, but I thought I'd fill in in case someone was debating on whether or not to get the 20 dollar set up charge.

104,zuckjeet,1622994220.0,ntoknq,192,372,"I was extremely happy when the Costco website introduced the 2-day shipping and 1-day shipping features. The nearest Costco is a little bit of a drive away and I can't always make it. So the new shipping options would help me order cheese, meat and snacks right to my door. Or so I thought. 

I have previously ordered using 2-day shipping, where one of my items was delivered (I kid you not) after two weeks. No harm, no foul, things happen. The other stuff that was supposed to be delivered in 2 days wasn't delivered in 2 days either. You know, not a problem‚Ä¶ it was a new feature then. 

But I recently ordered with 2-day shipping again, and it's been 2 days yesterday, and the order status still shows ""order is being prepared"". I have a feeling it won't be getting delivered before mid-week next week. 

Contrast that with the experience we have all had with Amazon. When they say ""two day delivery""‚Ä¶ they mean two day delivery. 

As retail industry has moved on and evolved, I am fearful that Costco will be left behind. I love the company and what it stands for. I love that they treat their employees much better. I was hoping Costco will set yet another standard in home delivery logistics while maintaining their reputation for treating their employees well. 

I am willing to forgive Costco a lot of things just because I'm not donating to the Bezos Empire every time I need something delivered to my house. Because this current order was delayed, won't mean I will die. But I do want the best for Costco, and I am afraid that most customers just want delivery to be held to the Amazon standard. 

To be relevant in twenty years from now, Costco has to step up its home delivery game by a big, big, big margin. 

This is somewhat of a longer post. I hope it doesn't come across as a rant. I'll continue to shop at Costco as long as I can.",Costco,2-day shipping: isn't,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ntoknq/2day_shipping_isnt/

115,driven2D,1622998760.0,ntq7w1,12,27,"The KS Ultra Clean liquid laundry detergent was on sale so I decided to give it a shot since it had pretty good reviews.  It was a pretty bad experience for me, but YMMV.  The scent is a little strong, but the real problem is how sudsy it is, especially since I have a front load HE washer.  The suds would build in volume and not rinse away easily, unlike most HE detergents.  I reduced the dosing every time to basically a teaspoon, would use an extra rinse, but it was still very sudsy and my towels were getting stiff.  I don't have soft water either (pretty medium, San Jose CA area).

&#x200B;

Then I had 2 loads of laundry throw an error on my machine mid-wash.  I searched online and the error code means that the machine is overflowing with water (it wasn't) or there are so many suds that it's tripping the overflow sensor.  I did notice the pump seemed to be running excessively long when initiating a spin cycle.  I re-washed that load with just water, and a lot of soap came out.  Then I ran the machine clean cycle and the amount of detergent build up after \~1 month of use was incredibly bad.  I knew the detergent had to go back.  Thankfully, Costco is great with returns, and I found my interaction with the CS rep interesting:

&#x200B;

""Hi, I'd like to return this please.  It's way too sud...""

""Clogged up your machine?""

""Yup.  Clearly you must get this a lot?""

""All the time.""

&#x200B;

So, I just wanted to pass along a warning of my experience with this product.  It seemed to clean well, but it started to damage my washing machine, and apparently I'm not alone.  I switched back to Tide (which was actually way cheaper on sale at Safeway than at Costco), and everything works perfectly again.

Last week I purchased these Melona frozen bars. Price approximately $0.35/each in box of 24. They tasted OK. I looked at ingredients and discovered they were made in Korea.

That made me think about what seemed to me impossible supply chain economics.

Made/frozen/packaged in Korea then shipped to my west coast Costco. 

1. Freezer truck to airport or shipping port in Korea.

2. Frozen shipping on plane or ship. 

3. Freezer truck from US port/airport to Costco. Customs fees etc.

4. Unpacking and stocking in Store. 

5. Cost of maintaining frozen until sold.

How is this even possible at this price? Are there freezer containers on ships? Are bulk air freight for frozen goods that low?

Probably not the correct reddit to ask this question but maybe someone here has an insight how this might work. If these were made in SF or LA I could understand the economics but Korea?",Costco,Supply Chain Economics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ns7zcj/supply_chain_economics/

239,evendree72,1622606149.0,nqcr6q,56,114,"I have been in almost all ancillary departments except, hearing aid, optical, photo, and tire center...  

My love is the deli, I started in the deli, and I wanted to move up, I was told it would be easy,  just work hard and learn as much as you can.

I learned meat department, food court, front end, member services, did S.I.T, went back to the deli, and I am a merchandiser.   I have always wanted to move up in the deli, for years I put in for supervisor spots, and was told, someone with more seniority, or knowledge, always got it, and I needed to know other areas of the warehouse.  Cool, I did that!

I tried again a few years later, was told I was was not knowledgeable enough with the AS400, and reports.  So I learned what I could access. 

Tried again. 
Was told I didn't know the Lingo enough.  Like the acronyms.   Okay. I went back to my manager and begged her to teach me. My department is one of the busiest in the region.  She refused  because we are too busy and she doesn't want to waste precious time outside of me and producing because I am one of her top producers.

She bullies and verbally tears down her crew of people and everyone is so used to the terrorizing ways we just take it and kept our heads down.  

Like I want to move up so fucking bad. Yet I have been told so much I am too nice, too talkative. Too friendly.  I have been told I will never move up over and over again by my old manager. 

I tried again recently,  I feel broken and so disheartening because even after 15 years of being a sponge, working my ass off, I am never good enough.  I know I am fat. I know I am not always the fastest. I get my job done.  What the fuck does it take to move up anymore.  It seems I must need to be a total brown noser or worse. I am not buddies or friends with managers,  nor do I want to be. I stay clear of being too friendly outside of work. I have seen some absolutely atrocious people be moved up who have no clue how to manage, have horrid communication skills. And yet they are all managers. 

Costco has broken me. I love and I hate Costco, but it's all I know, and I love working in the deli.  I want to be a deli manager some day but now I know.  I will never be anything but a grunt.

Costco has destroyed any self confidence I have had in the past. I have applied for over 13 years to probably 100 different supervisor spots. Nothing.  I came close once. I used to interview well, but my old manager did a number on my head, I stumble on my words and get so nervous now. Because I fear rejection, I know I am already rejected before I even try. They always have someone picked out anyways. Interviews are usually just formalities now days.  

I have been passed up for people I have so much more knowledge and experience on, and it will come to light they have family members that are managers in other stores,, its just so damn disheartening.   I don't know why I even try anymore.  Costco has destroyed my desire to be anything better because the rejection is destroying me.  Because they just want their good grunt workers to stay down so they can be pushed to the breaking point.  

I am so damn sad, angry at myself for wasting away my life and never getting farther. I wanted to grow with this company, I wanted to teach and help people grow. I wanted to be a deli manager. I am just the fat, annoying talkative person. I want to know what will make me good enough.  Will I ever be good enough? 
I have always been told I am a good teacher, patient, kind and very knowledgeable,  but its never enough!

260,christinathestorygrl,1622629834.0,nqipxw,18,3,"I've had terrible luck.  I've purchased four portable ACs from Costco over the last nine years and three of them were defective, failing within 18 months, four months, and the new one I got last week had broken caster wheels and started leaking after only two days of operation.

Despite this failure rate, I've told literally dozens of people that Costco is THE only option for buying a portable AC.  If you look at reviews on Costco and other sites, all portable ACs have like a 20-30% failure rate, and the manufacturers' warranties are worthless because you have to pay hundreds of dollars in round-trip shipping to utilize them.   The Costco return policy is your only protection against getting a $500-700 lemon.  I'm so passionate about protecting my friends and coworkers from this possibility that I've done everything except grab people by their lapels to get them to order through Costco rather than Amazon et al.

Well, now I've received my third AC lemon and it has to be returned.  We're of course going to replace it with another Costco portable AC, but I am TERRIFIED that I might get my membership revoked for doing another ""big"" return.

I think I'm a good Costco member!  I've had the Costco Visa card for years and I bought my home and car insurance through Costco.  I use Costco Optical and Pharmacy.  I shop at Costco once a week for groceries and that's my only gas station.

I do maybe two or three minor returns a year for issues like a foam pillow having a strong chemical odor or a clothing item not fitting.  Never anything stupidly abusive like returning a dead Christmas tree or a rotisserie chicken carcass or an 8 year old printer.

But returning a third portable AC unit freaks me out!  Does this seem like too much? Should I preemptively talk to a supervisor or the store manager?  Does anyone have any insight into what might trigger Costco to cancel your membership?

EDIT TO ADD:  

Well, my boyfriend and I returned the AC to the warehouse and the returns person said her own AC, also purchased at Costco, broke after a year!  So she was pretty sympathetic. When I told her I was afraid of getting kicked out of Costco, she said, ""no way, this is fine.""

If I take it back to the store, I know I will get the money back, but I also know that they will throw the item in the trash because it is open. I hate wasting food. Morally I cannot see it go to waste, but prefer it to be donated to a food bank. 

But if I don't return the item, I feel that Costco and the manufacturer will not know about this bad product. They will continue to stock it. So I want to know what do you all do in such situation

Does Costco refund you if you have already donated the food item?

353,LegendLarrynumero1,1622324874.0,nnx1xb,44,108,"I am an investor of Costco and love them as a company and stock.  Some things about them I've learned

Costco makes almost all profits on membership dues.  Sales minus costs and admin (salaries) wipes out all sales essentially.  

Membership renewal rate is almost 90%, very strong

Same store sales have continued to grow, at 16% increase

TIL Costco has their own chicken farm and two beef farms to supply their meat products

Costco opened their first store in China last year.  While they have stores in Taiwan, Korea and Japan already.

This first store in China is their largest and after one year produced 400,000 memberships!  It's in Shanghai, one of the largest cities but still! 

They have 2 more Chinese stores under construction in China.

I watched a video of the CEO walking through the store showcasing how great the low prices were.  The host asked if they could make more by raising the prices and the CEO laughed so hard!  ""That's not us!""

Costco's Mission:

""Here at Costco, we have a very straightforward, but important mission: to continually provide our members with quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices.""

Costco stock pays a dividend, but occasionally they will pay an extra dividend to reward investors!  Yes, their great service extends to shareholders too!

Costco stock has increased 24% int he past year and 165% over the past 5 years.

YET, on the 21st I saw a large purchase that would have been sense using the Costco Citi promotion and applied for a card on Costco's website at the checkout screen. This is important. After being approved I realized I only received an email for the last 4 digits of the card. Couldn't sign up on Citi's website with that info, but amazingly if I wanted to renew my Costco card (that was due in a few days...) I could see the card's last 4 on Costco's website, so OBVIOUSLY there was some form of communication between Costco and Citi, even if I couldn't use the card to renew (or check out)

Called Costco that following Saturday after going into the store to inquire about how to pay for this large item. Got a temp card to renew my stuff, but the temp card doesn't work online. Gotta call Citi. Called Citi. Was told I have to wait for the physical card in the mail - no way to expedite. NO WAY TO EXPEDITE?!?!? So at this point I've likely pulled a hard credit to get a CC that I can't use. No virtual cards and no way for Citi to help me pay for what was on Costco's site.

Now, I almost focused my hate exclusively on Citi as they issued the card...BUT COSTCO ADVERTISES SIGNING UP FOR THE DAMN CARD WHEN CHECKING OUT!!!! Imagine if you were about to drop $4k on something on Amazon and they were like ""hey, sign up for our CC....thank you. You're approved! Now wait 7-10 business days for the actual card to come in the mail before purchasing. But don't worry, we'll send hourly reminders that you have items in your shopping cart!!!!!""

Last Weds I got a notice in the mail...that my card was on its way. Full of promotional crap that had no bearing on me. Naturally my large purchase went Out of Stock the day the promotion ended and now I have a CC that I couldn't use. I'll wait for a 4th of July sale or whatnot just so I can exercise the warranty feature, but if that wasn't the case I'd use my Discover card, get that 5% back for warehouse purchases online, and dip. 

Costco: You shouldn't try to pimp a card at the checkout screen if folks can't use it ASAP. Citi, you shouldn't act like you can't expedite a card for first-time issues. If it was a replacement I could have allegedly had it FedEx, which blew my mind. Furthermore I read on a forum that if you claimed you were doing international travel that may trigger the release; I shouldn't have to lie to get a card to use!

I was having issues with my iphone X and was way past due for an upgrade. u/Costco told me purchasing at Verizon was terrible and Costco, my trusted retailer, would give me a better service experience. I told him exactly what I wanted- 12 mini in red, case, trade in, pay in full and transfer my stuff. He said no problem and we started. First, they had no red or symmetry case. Fine, just get it done. He sent me to pay but they only took $50 for tax. He explained I couldn't return it if I paid in full and to NOT pay Verizon until I was sure I would keep. Sure, ok. AFTER I was an hour spent into the process he warns me he probably won't be able to transfer my stuff. I was furious. I calmly explained this was his #1 selling point against Verizon in the first minute of his speal and it was unenthical to disparage them for something he couldn't do anyway. Blah, blah, blah. He said (all puffed up and bullish) he was sorry I was upset and did I want to finish. I was 90 minutes in and my old phone wasn't working so I said fine. At the end I asked about my trade in and he said I had to do it with Verizon! WHAT?

I called Verizon when I got home and he lied about the pay in full and return policy and he signed me up for a 2 year contract, which I have not for 10 year. (I signed NOTHING and the word was not mentioned.) I have to return it before I can do anything more to fix. I have an appt at their store to have them fix everything. I truly cannot believe Costco would allow a business like that to operate in their stores. Shameful!

P.S. Per the comments- the issue is he outright lied about several things and signed me up for a contract that I did not consent to. It was NEVER EVEN MENTIONED and I did not sign anything...and yes, I have transferred my stuff from icloud before. i was looking to have it all done at once but acknowledge the convenience probably doesn't trump security. :-) Verizon will make it right but this was fraudulent.

Costco item #3845008 is two Regal Cinemas movie tickets and as of a couple days ago is still $5.97. They were in stock, but limit 10 sets (20 tickets) per member/transaction at Costco #1342 in Fairbanks, Alaska (the world's northernmost Costco). Cashiers were encouraging people to buy the limit as the price could go up any day and less than $2.99 per ticket is a great deal.

400,PhilosopherSimple503,1622221403.0,nn2e37,34,41,"I‚Äôve worked at costco for two years. I hate every waking second of it. The complete lack of training, braindead management, rampant nepotism, sexual harassment, revolving door of employees, and fickle safety procedures are just a few of my concerns. Our warehouse manager asking Covid-positive employees who didnt show symptoms to still work their shifts is yet another concern.
Being screwed out of my Covid bonus as a part timer who works full time hours is, again, yet another concern.

When I started, I really gave it my all, but it slowly faded, starting with when they promoted a man in the warehouse who was well known to sexually harass every female coworker in the store, all because he was cozy with management, not because he was even remotely close to fulfilling his job description.

The only reason I‚Äôve stayed at all is to transfer out of state then immediately look for something else after moving. I‚Äôve been sending out transfer requests and job bank applications left and right since the start of this year, and can‚Äôt seem to secure anything or get any opportunity to leave my warehouse. I‚Äôve put in for almost 40 jobs, interviewed for about half of those applications. Nothing.

Look, I‚Äôm remaining cautiously hopeful that this is just my current store, not the company as a whole. I would love to transfer to see if an older more established warehouse has it‚Äôs shit at least somewhat together. But what now? I‚Äôm in great standing, near perfect attendance, perfect reviews, and even letters of recommendation, but I get nothing but transfer denials, rejection letters, or just complete radio silence on any job transfer I apply to.

Is it even worth trying to transfer with this company? Because my mental health means much more to me than Jelinek‚Äôs stock going up a quarter of a percent.

I am curious to know when to expect a response from them- will they contact me even if they‚Äôre rejecting my application?

Hi, I have been a member since the Price Club days. I have always told people they should buy TVs from Costco because they are a no hassle return/repair/replace store. I said this having never returned anything before. I used the concierge system once and was directed how to reset my TV which solved my issue back then. Last year I bought a TCL 50"" from Costco, and it worked great. Thirteen months later, the TV failed by displaying only vertical purple and black bars. I have gone through at least 7 - 10 calls over the past month. They could never get through to service dispatch. I was told multiple times that I would be called by them in 24-48 business hours. In frustration, I took the TV to the store where I was informed that they couldn't take the TV back or help me in any way without authorization. I called concierge services again and went through the usual pattern of waiting while they tried to reach someone in service. After yet another 30-45 minute call, I was given the number to call service myself. Late last week I was finally able to get a call through to service dispatch. I was given instructions how to take 4 pictures and email them in. I did this. I still didn't hear anything. I resized the pictures in case the files were too large and resent them. several days later still nothing so I called again. I was told that the pictures didn't clearly show all four corners of the TV, but I had trimmed the photos down to just the TV to make the file smaller. I was informed that I need to take all of the pictures again and resubmit. them wait 2-3 business days before checking back. They will not reach out, you must continually call them. So, I guess I am venting because I will likely not have resolution until next month, at least after Monday. Is this typical? I'm really disappointed with this process, given the reputation that Costco enjoys. My first return in over 30 years isn't impressing me.

Now, I know what the savings. I find the Kirkland ones to be of such low quality. Every patty I have eaten has had smalls chunks of bone or gristle. They are flavorless and greasy. Is it just me? Did I get a bad bag? Is this possibly covid related with a lack in quality in meats? I noticed some bags of the Kirkland chicken breasts being off so I was wondering if maybe it was that.

I was so disappointed I was going to return them, but my kids said they were fine.

I didn‚Äôt receive the option to schedule a delivery date at checkout, it just said that the expected date is 6/2 and I would receive a call to schedule. My question is whether or not I am going to have any trouble scheduling delivery as far out as after 6/20?

I called customer service and the only thing I was told was appliances are taking longer to be delivered right now so it probably wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. I was hoping to get a more concrete answer than that. Most advice I have seen says order appliances early because everything is taking longer than usual right now, but if I get contacted for delivery sooner than later will they let me schedule it as far out as 6/21-ish.

Firstly I was hired as an AM stocker which is a nice change of pace from my old job. But anyways, I tried searching for the answers on this subreddit and google but I just couldn't find them. Anyways...

*  So tomorrow is my first 8 hour shift. From what I've read, I can't work more than 5 hours straight without a lunch I think? Also when I do go on lunch, do I have to tell anyone or is that kind of like my 15 minute breaks?

* So it seems like to me stocking kind of ""ends"" when the store opens. Was curious about who I should go to next to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing? It seems like from what I've read, front end work is pushing carts, cashier assistant and working the snack bar. I'm also wondering if I'll be trained on those things or if it's a ""trial by fire"" kind of thing.

* Finally, I think one of the women who work HR told me if I'm going from AM stocking to like ""open store hours"" work that I can't wear a t-shirt and cargo shorts. So I'm wondering if that means like polo and khakis or something similar? Any clarification would be great.

I got a pair of clear 1.67 glasses and a pair of sunglasses in polycarbonate. To make a long story short, the sunglasses in poly worked fine but I could not focus on the 1.67 pair. The optician checked the Rx and offered to remake them in a different frame. Same issue.

Since 2014, I've purchased another pair of sunglasses in the poly material and again, I have zero issues (I love the polarization and mirror finish!). Well, I'm in need of another pair of sunglasses, and I'm told that you no longer offer polycarbonate lenses -- that you recently switched manufacturers. Is that correct?

So there's a few questions raised in my experience. Why do you think that your 1.67 lens material didn't work for me all those years ago? Something to do with the physics? And lastly, now that you've changed manufacturers, do you think I will run into the same issue again? Is the manufacturer who makes the 1.67 lens also making the 1.6 as well? (In which case I won't be able to use you for sunglasses anymore). Or the manufacturer completely different now?

Anyhoo, last week my sibling alerted me of an unadvertised sale at Costco, $5 off for the above Charmin TP!  I went on Friday afternoon and the shelf was empty and the price sign indicated that the sale will end today with a limit of 2.

Undeterred, I returned on Saturday morning at around 915AM and was stunned to see the parking lot more than half full.  And I thought I was the early bird.  I expected to see some Charmin because I speculated Costco would restock it at the beginning of the day.  Sadly, I was wrong and the shelf was empty again.  When I asked the clerk when he expected another shipment, he said he didn't know and suggested I call and check tomorrow.  Then he removed the sign displaying the product and the discounted price.  That's not good.

On Sunday afternoon, I drove to the woods for a long walk. Since Costco is between the woods and my home, I decided to stop by on a hunch on the way home.  I was surprised I was able to find a parking spot given the time of the day.  Then I made a beeline to the same spot and was delighted to see four columns of TP about 7 feet high.  I almost let out a whoop of joy.

I realized the system is defective because it reboots every several minutes. After chatting with an incompetent tech support person I was told I would need to send it to them for inspection/repair.

I could return the item to costco for a replacement for sure but one problem I have is with the promotion I relied on. The product page last month indicated if I pay for it with the Costco Citi card I'd get back $250. This type of promotion was on a lot of product pages. I just can't find the conditions now though. Does anyone know what I am referring to and have a link to some description maybe?

If I return the item for replacement I am worried it may mess up the promo and make it seem like I returned the original item and bought it back again in May.  If that were the case I may bite the bullet and deal with Swann RMA process. The after-'rebate' cost may be OK for this system but list price is a bit much.

I'm going to leave out the product name so as not to expose ""member pricing"" on anything in particular... but I suspect anybody with a membership can figure out which specific item I'm referring to. ;)

There is currently a TV on sale at my local warehouse for $2699, and it includes a ""$200 rebate"" in the form of a Costco Cash card.

That pricing is good through 5/18. Starting 5/19, the same TV goes down to $2199 (it is in in the local flyer/mailer that has pricing starting 5/19 and good through 6/20 or something, which is how I know what the new price will be).

I'm sure you can guess where I'm going with this... 
If I were to buy it now at $2699, I'm pretty sure they would allow an adjustment to the new price on Wednesday (I've done this before with a different item in the past).

But would Costco tell me I have to return (or pay back) the $200 gift card?

819,NookinFutz,1621083644.0,ncyd9h,21,39,"We've been looking for almost a year for LVP flooring that's waterproof to replace the older laminate in our home.  We needed approximately 1700 square feet, every location except the bathrooms, needed new flooring.

We shopped all of the local and national home-improvement stores, and when we saw that Costco was selling Mohawk, we called / emailed and asked for floor samples.

We compared those samples sent with the quality and prices being asked by the home-improvement stores and one local flooring store, and decided based upon the quality and the return / guarantee of Costco that we would pull the plug and purchase.

We waited until it went back on sale at $39.99 per box, placed our order, watched our sales savings show up, and then realized that the shipping fee of $250 from other stores was also included.  

We just had it installed (finally!) after waiting almost two months for our installer to put us on the schedule.  He was impressed with the quality, asked me about the pricing -- and when I told him that the price included the shipping from the factory he was impressed.

We could NOT be happier with this choice, with the service / shipping from Costco to Mohawk and even the return services of the unused boxes.

If you are thinking about upgrading one of your rooms and/or your house and considering LVP, do consider Costco.  Read what others are saying on the reviews, and watch for the sales.  Right now, all of the previous eight options of this flooring are sold out on the website.

The reviewers said not to purchase the transition pieces because the coloring was off, so we simply took a sample to our local flooring store and purchased enough for our transition into our bathrooms and laundry room.  

The reviewers warned about rocking chairs, office chairs, etc. and to use mats, even though this flooring is 'scratch proof.'

The one bad thing that we kinda realized as they were pulling up the older flooring is that this flooring is thinner, so all of our baseboards will need to be touched up and repainted.

And one of the bigger tips we read / learned was to order 15% more, watch for batch numbers, etc.  A lot of the reviews said that the shipping was horrible, and I think instead of sending the flooring via freight, they were shipping it via UPS / Fed Ex -- and the boxes were damaged.  Since ours was a larger order, it was shipped and delivered via freight and contained on pallets.  We had not one broken box in the delivery.

While many complained that the board width was not consistent, that problem must have been fixed, as each box that was opened and reviewed was the same width, had no cracks, and we only had one board that wasn't finished properly.

With a household of dogs, sand, water, soon-to-be returning visitors, we couldn't be happier with our savings and quality.

My only wish is that Costco / Mohawk would recommend local installers.  We choose the professional installers as we needed their expertise to remove all of the previous room transitions installed.  Our flooring is now seamless, no more tripping over that stupid transition.  Reviews on the website said that many homeowners installed this themselves for additional savings.

Props to Mohawk for a fine product and Costco for providing a cost-savings way of upgrading homes.",Costco,Mohawk LVP Flooring and Costco,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ncyd9h/mohawk_lvp_flooring_and_costco/

So I called the Costco concierge service and the person there told me that a second appointment is *not* required for a dishwasher ""unless they can't fit it into the space or whatever.""

So now I'm totally confused.  Can experienced Costco dishwasher recipients fill me in here? How does this work?  In particular:  

(1) is it one appointment or two?  

(2) If two, how/when/with whom do you make the second appointment? 

(3) Is it my responsibility to detach my current dishwasher so that it's ready to be carted away?

(4) If the answer to (3) is yes, and the whole process requires *two* appointments, must I detach my current dishwasher before the **first** or the **second** of the two appointments?

(5) Why on earth does the Costco online ordering experience not explain this process? (that question is rhetorical...)

Feels like I have exhausted all my options to no avail. But firstly want to say I have been a executive member for almost 3 years now and got the Citi card and love it. 

 

 It all started 3 months back. I saw that I had only accumulated $4.15 for the last 10 months. My Citi card had $85+. So I went to the customer service counter and they couldn't explain it at all. They did some looking around and found out we had spent about $4500 in the last 10 months.  Then asked me a few questions. ""Did you buy a lot of gas?"" no, covid working from home. ""Have you been returning a lot of items?"" nope. The folks behind the counter talked within themselves for a few minutes asking each other questions, gave up, took my number told me they will reach out to their manager and get back to me. 2 weeks passed nothing.

&#x200B;

So I went in again, this time some other person was there. He asked the same questions. Again took my number and said he would call. I asked if I could get some kind of a service request/ ticket number he said no. It has been 6 weeks, haven't heard anything.

&#x200B;

While I was waiting I also called the customer service number. Told them what happened, same questions. They said they will do an investigation. Again I asked if I could get a ticket/service request number. They said no but they also said they will update my account profile and would receive an email. Haven't received anything not even a email confirmation.

I'm headed to San Francisco in September and CT is offering a really crazy rate on a Marriot + rental car. As this is San Francisco, you don't really need a car to get around plus parking that rental car is gonna cost somewhere around $50-100 bucks a night and I'm 99% sure the parking cost is not included in the package. 

So will you get penalized if you skip getting the rental car?
