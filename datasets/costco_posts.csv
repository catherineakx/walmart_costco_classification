I like to sample poutines from anywhere I can. From fast food chains to diners and even chip trucks on the side of the road. I've tried them all and 99% of the time, they make it wrong.

The fries are too thin and flimsy, the gravy is to salty and I feel like I wanna kill myself after I eat it, cheese curds are too small or the wrong cheese or even worse, they use shredded cheese! 
By the halfway point, the gravy has melted all the cheese and the fries are now soggy and it's basically this soupy mess and I dont like that.

Costo however, has this shit done right.

First point: Costco Fries - How can you go wrong? By themself, they are amazing but you add gravy and curds to it? Oh fuck me wonderful. They hold their shape and dont get soggy to the point of falling apart. I've bought poutine, brought it home, forgot about it for an hour because something else came up, came back to it and it's still solid. The fries are still fry shaped and hold together.

Next Point: The Gravy - I don't know what gravy Costco uses, I've had plenty of the gravy on my poutine and it's delicious, I think it's some mix of Chicken and beef gravy but one of them is watered down a bit so the flavour isnt too strong overshadowing the other gravy but rather complimenting it. I could be wrong and it's shit from a can like St. Huberts or something. Either way its good. It's light, not really salty at all and I dont feel like a piece of shit after eating it.

Final point: The Cheese - Costco uses real cheese curds, big ones too! They open a fresh bag of curds for every poutine. These dont melt, hold their shape and are fucking delicious!

CA is in such a dire drought situation this year, that fire season is inevitably going to be catastrophic. Why even sell anything that encourages the behavior of setting off fireworks?!

13,GTSBurner,1624570970.0,o7aj9z,17,13,"I needed to get a new Window AC unit for my home office.  I had a ""hand-me-down"" unit last year that was EXTREMELY loud and I couldn't get any work done.  So I needed something that was quiet and performed.  

I looked into a mini-split system but because of a design issue with the area I wanted cooled, it wasn't going to work. 

Since I wasn't getting the mini-split, I invested part of that budget into a new TV, and for the AC, I had a budget of around $350.  I also didn't want to buy another window A/C that I was going to hate, so I took a flyer with Costco's return policy.

**Folks, I'm amazed by this thing.**

So few things off the bat:

This Danby AC appears to be a re-badged version of the Midea u-shaped window AC that is on Amazon.  It's also a little cheaper than the Midea one, by about $20 bucks.

(One of the biggest giveaways that this is a Midea re-brand is that in Danby's own installation video, the tech is wearing a Midea shirt - the logo is pretty obscured except for a few moments) 

Buying Experience: Purchased it, and it arrived a few days earlier than promised, however the box had a little damage to it, but not enough to impact the materials inside. 

Installation: It's a little bit more complicated than your typical window AC and it's definitely a 2-person job, if not just for the extra set of hands.  I set it up with family member, and we're both pretty tech/build savvy, and it took us about an hour to get it properly set.

(disclosure: the setup we had was atypical positioning, so if you are a two-person team that is build savvy, it'll probably take you less than that) 

Sound: OK, I know we talk decibels and all of this, so I'll just use real world comparisons.  Before the AC I was using a Holmes dual-blade window fan, which I enjoyed almost as white noise. This thing is quieter than the window fan.  Much quieter.  

You can definitely hear the difference the window makes as a sound barrier open and closed, but even with the window open, the sound isn't bad AT ALL.   This is on a second story window, and from the outside on the ground, you can't hear this thing.  

Energy efficiency:  From all indicators I see both on Costco's reviews, Amazon's reviews on the Midea machine, and the box's label, not only is this thing quiet, but it's also extremely energy efficient.  We'll have to see more on this.

Aesthetics: The AC itself looks nice.  One issue I'm going to have to figure out is privacy - I'll most likely need to add curtains to the window because since there's no ""accordions"" like on a window fan or a AC unit, you can look right in the window.  

Summary: If you have a space of less than 350 square feet you need cooled and you have a budget of about $350 dollars, you cannot go wrong with this.  The quietness checks all boxes, but the fact that it's energy efficient (which makes it an even better value than other $350 window ACs on the market) is a HUGE win.

Fast forward to today... delivery window just woooshes by and another 90 minutes on hold.... ""oh sorry, a truck didnt come in and your appliance is on there""... RESCHEDULED for beginning of JULY now...

My question is - would this be something that would be covered under warranty? If it's a software issue would they just say ""wait till the next update"" or something? The tv works but it's annoying cause it flashes no input across the entire screen and goes black every time I pause something.

- contractor bags (we have a lot of property and are forever cleaning outside and doing yard work)

I'm leaning toward an online purchase, because from what I've read, there's no Costco-endorsed delivery service for in-store purchases (see Ref 1). Please correct me if I'm wrong about this. My mom wouldn't be able to deliver and assemble the furniture herself, so we'd need professionals for help with this. 

I'm hesitant about purchasing furniture online, because ideally, we'd want to see it in-person. If we go to the store, there's no guarantee that the in-store furniture will match the ones online.

I also read about ""White Glove"" service, where delivery personnel will not only deliver but also assemble everything for you. Apparently, this service starts at $50. I also came across the term ""brown box delivery"". Here's what I read about it (see Ref 2):

 ""If order is not brown box delivery, the delivery team will:

* Un-carton and place in room of choice
* Assemble where applicable""

I'm not sure what brown box deliveries are. Is anyone here familiar with this?

What have been your experiences with purchasing furniture from Costco online? Is there anything you wish you had known? If you purchased furniture in-store, were you able to hire professionals to help deliver it for you?

I appreciate any insights into the matter. We're really interested in purchasing furniture from Costco online, but there are limitations because we would definitely need professional delivery service and assembly.

I know our oven is a little trash, so turning the heat lower generally helps and cooking a little longer, but my issue is that the package says lift one corner to let heat escape, after like 20 mins or so it smells like burning plastic, and that top plastic sheet that as directed to lift the corner is shrinking and seems like that's what's burning!?

I tried wrapping it in foil and leaving a corner open but it didn't cook after 1 hour was still cold !! 

it cooked well enough when I removed the foil and just let the cheese almost burn but the bottom was still a bit frozen, should I just keep the plastic top on with the corner lifted?

I always buy prime steaks from Costco, whether it's NY strips, filets or ribeyes and previously I'd never had any problems. However last week, I had bought 4 prime filets and they looked fine but after opening I did notice a little funky smell, almost like a dry aged funk type smell but I prepared them anyways to be cooked. 

When preparing them I noticed that two of the filets were much softer but I salt and peppered them up and threw them on the grill. When grilling I noticed some temp irregularities in the two ""soft"" filets while the other two were consistent throughout the steak. Once they were cooked to medium-rare to medium I pulled them off to let them rest. Then at dinner time the funky smell became more noticeable, possibly once the two ""soft"" filets were cut open. The outsides were ""edible"" but once we got towards the middle ""soft"" portion, we noticed this nasty pinkish-grey? (I'm color blind so who knows exactly what color it was) almost pate like substance. We instantly stopped eating. The other two steaks which our guests were eating were good but dinner was ruined for my wife and I. 

As this had never happened to me I'm not sure what I would do. It's pretty annoying to have paid $25/lb or however much it was for prime filets and to lose $30. I don't know what Costco would have done had I brought my bad steaks to them cooked a few days prior but I'd feel like a weirdo bringing a plate of cooked steaks to customer service and waiting in like for 30 minutes to get a $30 credit for a pound of bad filets.

1. expiry date between mid spring into late summer usually have larger slices but always burned. we smell burned wood, not potato chips when we open the bag. the chips are usually black with very little brown or yellow potato colour. some even have burned holes and taste bitter. some chip just taste weird and oily as well. on average, 3.5 out of 5 bags are like this during the season (per expiry date)


2. expiry date between mid fall until late winter usually have smaller slices. they are almost always in yellow potato colour and taste great. we buy triple (not counting a few people's secret snaking stashes) from these batches. on average, 4.7 out of 5 bags are like this during the season (per expiry date)",Costco,Seasonal change to Kirkland Signature Himalayan Salt Potato Chips?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/o2vzhe/seasonal_change_to_kirkland_signature_himalayan/

And are there anyways to pause the stat tracking while processing a member? (I.e., member starts asking about item or has a question... Right now I am doing total, then debit/credit... Still unsure if that works)

224,papmom24,1624039778.0,o2wcbj,34,0,"I had three terrific interviews with Costco-that‚Äôs why I had three and not only one. I was told ‚Äúwe do want to move forward with you, we will have you meet with the GM in the next few days!‚Äù No call. I called back and was told ‚Äúwe misspoke-the current hiring group is in the next few days, YOUR meeting with the GM will be scheduled the following week!‚Äù No call. I called back-it rang twice and disconnected. Twenty times, different times of day, this happened. Used a friend‚Äôs phone, they picked right up. The same person who had been extremely excited about me was downright hostile ‚Äúwe never said you‚Äôd be moving forward with the GM (that‚Äôs 100% untrue, I was told this multiple times), we are in the process of deciding whether to move forward with you or not. We will call you either way.‚Äù No call. 

Here‚Äôs the thing. During interview number three, the person who interviewed me happened to mention that her 80 year old grandmother works at the same company I worked at until full retirement. In the same facility. She never mentioned names but it didn‚Äôt take me very long to find out who she is. So, I KNOW who her grandma is-I don‚Äôt know this woman and more importantly, she‚Äôs never once spoken to me, so she doesn‚Äôt know me either. That being said, there was a very complicated situation I was subjected to during my time there that was designed to appear to be misleading and definitely was humiliating. I won‚Äôt go into the whole thing here but I was 100% innocent of any wrongdoing, while this woman who put me in this misleading situation was involuntarily demoted and then she AND the boss who backed her play BOTH ‚Äúretired‚Äù on the exact same date, EXTREMELY prematurely-in her case, by about two decades. Of the three of us, I was the ONLY one who was allowed to pick my own retirement date and to work to full retirement. Someone who has worked there to the age of 80 would have to be pretty dim not to be able to see all the way through what this looked like-it looked like I had done something horrible, and the rumors as to what that might have been were rampant, but the facts bear out who was innocent and which two were not. Only one of us got to choose our retirement date and to retire at full retirement, and that was ME. There was no reason to get into this humiliating situation that seems to keep coming back to haunt me although I was fully exonerated after not one but TWO investigations-she definitely tried to find something/anything on me but she never did, and her egregious abuse of authority bit her BIG time. The problem is that my situation coming out completely good was kept pretty quiet, as was this woman AND the boss who backed her play having adverse action held against the both of them behind what they did to me. If people weren‚Äôt really paying attention, they weren‚Äôt going to notice how these two ended up-but the fact that I was there with no reduction of pay until my full retirement date really SHOULD have been a clue, but it‚Äôs always so much more fun to believe dirt about someone, regardless of how innocent they are. 

Here‚Äôs my question. It‚Äôs painfully obvious that interviewer number three went home after so many successful interviews where I was told they were absolutely definitely moving forward with me, and she got whatever scandalous version of the actions this heinous woman took against me, of course leaving out that I had passed two comprehensive financial audits 100% successfully, I was fully exonerated of ANY wrongdoing, I was allowed to retire at my full retirement date as opposed to two decades early in this woman‚Äôs case who had acted extremely inappropriately towards me and our boss suddenly retired on the same date three years before he had stated that he had planned. Is this legal for this person who interviewed me to go home and disclose details of an applicant for a job with someone completely unrelated to that process? I‚Äôd be so grateful just to have a conversation with them to clear my name because I held up to nearly a year of having my life completely torn apart by a woman I had had a personal argument with decades earlier about high school football (her son ended up in jail for vandalism of our school locker room-I had no idea he was involved, I brought this up in a social situation, and she got flaming mad and, quite obviously, held a grudge and paid me back decades later in a way that truly defies logic). I mean, just the very basic facts bear out that I was completely innocent of any wrongdoing, but the actions she took were extremely high profile and looked BAD-she did that intentionally. The FACT that she got into trouble for doing it has been very quiet but it would be so easy to verify. But my question is, why is such a thing even allowed to be an issue in an interview and hiring process? And, since it clearly was, why am I not allowed due process to even explain? I studied labor Union management in college. I‚Äôve interviewed and hired/fired people myself so I KNOW what they‚Äôve done is not legal. What recourse do I have to explain that they‚Äôve acted upon a rumor that was demonstrably proven untrue over ten years ago.",Costco,Is this legal in a Costco Interview,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/o2wcbj/is_this_legal_in_a_costco_interview/

Anyone bought the Hexclad set of pans last year at Costco?  We were excited that finally, a company that stands by their product if we follow their instructions on taking care of them; it would be lifetime warrantied free of defects and best of all, guaranteed to be non-stick proof. 

Well, it has been 6 months of daily use of the 10"" pan and it's now sticky when frying eggs  (Our 12"" is still going strong).  Previously, it has been working flawlessly as all my fried eggs (over easy) have been perfect as I was able to flip them over with no issues.

So I went to Hexclad's website to put in my warranty claim and it asks for serial number... Has anyone been able to locate the serial numbers? Can't find them in any of the pans.  They are supposed to be very small and begin with a BYxxxxxxx.  Surprised there are very few websites or nobody did a Youtube on this...

Not a big deal though as Hexclad didn't require serial number to be input.  Was just curious if any Costco members have found them.",Costco,Hexclad pans,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/o1x1pp/hexclad_pans/

*‚ÄúThank you for your recent claim request. Regretfully, your claim is not eligible for payment for the following reason(s):*

***The item failure occurred outside of the coverage period.***

*Your claim is denied because per the Terms and Conditions, we will extend the manufacturer‚Äôs warranty for an additional 24 Months. Your loss occurred during Costco's additional 2nd year warranty, thus no coverage applies.‚Äù*

So are they saying my ‚Äúloss‚Äù occurred while still covered by Costco‚Äôs extended warranty, even though I contacted them after that time period was up? Will they (Costco) even recognize a warranty claim over a year after the fact? Has anyone else experienced this?

I was curious if people who chose not to wear masks, which is legal if vaccinated, felt awkward, ready to fight or like somehow like a villain.

I felt bad for staff. When I was coming in I could hear someone on the exiting side trying to explain that the state says people who are vaccinated don‚Äôt need to wear masks.

&#x200B;

We ordered a new mattress from Costco.  This included delivery and haul away of the old mattress.  Delivery was set for yesterday and we received text and emails that we can expect delivery between 10:45am and 12:45pm local time yesterday.  Thus, yesterday morning, we disassembled our bed, moved the mattress out to the front porch, and took our bed frame and such down and into storage.  We set up the new platform for the new mattress to sit atop.  By 2pm, the new mattress had not arrived, and we called and did the Costco call back because their customer service lines were backed up.  By the time we got the call back around 3pm, the Costco rep tells us that the delivery team realized the mattress had water damage, and told Costco around 1pm.   The issue is NOBODY bothered to tell us.  We were told they will get a replacement mattress and let us know.

Then, at 5pm we got an email that is ""as you know, flooding has impacted your order, but good news, your mattress is in at your local delivery facility, please click here to schedule delivery"".  The dates are all out a week or so, so I called Costco customer services, sat on hold for 45 minutes, and the line hung up.....

&#x200B;

Very frustrating experience obviously, compounded by we had to more our mattress back inside, and redo a bunch of work we had done to prepare for the delivery.    Also, I am baffled as there has been NO flooding in our area or even rain for many weeks.  If the mattress they pulled at 9am was damaged, why the heck didnt ANYONE call or email us, before we did all this work to prepare for the delivery.

&#x200B;

I am going to try calling again today when Costco customer service opens, but I want my mattress today, and I also want some fairly significant discount/compensation for all this inconvenience.

**Friday, June 11**: called customer service at 8:58 AM and was on the line for 1 hour 9 minutes. I was told my delivery was rescheduled for Wednesday, June 16. I asked for a supervisor who called logistics and the delivery was rescheduled for Saturday, June 12.

**Saturday June 12**: I received a call at 9:15 AM from someone at the warehouse saying my delivery will not be going out today. They will call back later with an update. 4:39 PM I receive a voicemail and 4 back to back emails stating my delivery is rescheduled for Friday, June 18th.

337,IanZee,1623682671.0,nzoogh,16,3,"I have a two-year old sectional I purchased from Costco in September 2019 for $1000. So far, the quality has been dog water. 

The threads are coming out of the cushions making them look tattered. I'd imagine the manufacturer used short-staple cotton threads and they are starting to separate. I was willing to live with this since it's an aesthetic issue and not a functional one.

However, last week, the springs started to pop off of the frame. I'm not even sure why - my wife and I are not heavy people. We don't have kids to jump on the furniture. Our dogs weigh all of 15 lbs. There is now a visible sag in the cushion.

I contacted Costco, they gave me the number for the manufacturer. I called the manufacturer and they are only willing to pay for the parts - I'd have to find a place to repair it and pay for the labor. I'm not sure I'm willing to do that since the couch is starting to come apart not even two years after purchase.

What would you do in this situation? For $1000, I expected better quality, especially since it is manufactured at an American country (Klaussner). But I can already tell this couch is just going to come apart on me.

Recently though, there's been this nasty smell on the toilet paper. Quite sad because I actually used to like it a lot - was pretty sturdy and cheap and with a good texture. 

The new smell now though just smells, dirty? chemical-y? It's hard to describe but it's really pungent. It's there straight off the roll, and gets *much* worse if the toilet paper is wet.

Tuesday text message: Can you pick up another Spindrift box? They are still on sale.

Wednesday phone call: Can you get Buddy's prescription before you come home? The vet sent it to the Costco Pharmacy.

Thursday text message: Tacos tonight? If so, please get that cheese we like, some spring mix, and some tortillas. And a HomePod Mini too.

Friday phone call while he is on break: Are you in the wine section? I need a Phantom and that Zin everyone liked last time.

I get a discount through work on appliances through LG. And they use costco logistics (innovel solutions) to deliver. I placed my first order for a refrigerator early april, item is scheduled for delivery beginning of May. They call and tell me it's raining so they can't deliver and will reschedule. I'm like whatever, fine. 

They delivered the item in a coupled of days, installed it and walked out before I got a chance to inspect it, it had a dent in the front, so i had to get them to to come pick it up for return the next day and I placed a 2nd order. It took a couple weeks for it to reach the warehouse and I finally got to schedule it for this monday. The 2 hour window  comes and goes, nothing from the delivery people yet, i called their support and the lady said she has no idea why but it was rescheduled to wednesday but it was on the truck for delivery and they didn't finish the route for some reason and thats why it got rescheduled, i'm like WTF nobody told me and I had to take the day off for this to stay home. She was like im sorry etc etc for your trouble and said it would be delivered on Wednesday. Tuesday evening i was supposed to get a call with my 2 hour delivery window - that didn't happen, I called support and they were closed. So I call first thing wednesday morning and the agent says he has NEVER seen this happen before but one system says it was scheduled and another didn't so it didn't actually get scheduled for delivery and he scheduled it for friday. So that's 2 days off wasted. And now it's friday, and i get a call from the warehouse saying they don't have the right item?! I'm LIVID. How was it on the vehicle for delivery on Monday if they never had the right item in the first place ? He said he has no idea how this was missed and will talk to the origin warehouse and see whats happening.

This is so fucking ridiculous. And costco support can't even help me with some kind of refund for all the trouble because my order is through LG.

Rami, who might be a supervisor, looked for appropriate tires and showed them to me. Then he said he'd try to get approval to mount them after hours. Well time dragged on as my son and I had difficulties finding a way to pay for the tires. **Nota Bene!** Costco  does NOT accept Master Card debit or credit cards! That was all we had between us, a couple each but all Master Cards. Also, the ATM inside the store, which Rami got us access to, doesn't work with Master Card debit cards, my son was unable to get cash. Strangely, when I later tried with my European debit card (Master Card), I was able to get cash.

So the tires were paid for and a very (extremely) patient Rami and his associate, whose name I unfortunately did not get, mounted and balanced the tires and all work was finished pretty close to 6pm. Amazing!

Of course I tried to give them a tip but they refused saying something about a fine (or did he say fired?) if they accepted. He asked me to leave a nice review instead - no problem!

No apologies, no offer of compensation, no solutions - just passing from one company or dept. to another. I told them to cancel and come get the broken one - they refused! I had to threaten a chargeback and throwing the damn thing into the street before they would magically organise the pickup. They also double charged me 200 dollars for another order they said they'd cancelled but didn't.

Total time wasted: 5+ hours on hold and talking to people that just have a script and never deviate. Even the managers.

Never. Ever. Again. will I order from the Costco website. I only wish I'd seen others' experience before doing so.

Order now in with Lowes because I can go see it and confirm stock in the store.

Edit: just to clarify, Costco delivered and installed the broken dishwasher in April. The whole thing has been comically bad and not even so much as a 'have a free hotdog' or something for the hours of wasted time. So, that's four failed attempts to get a dishwasher installed and working and their best answer today was to simply reorder it and send me to the back of the queue.

455,Far-Pizza-6939,1623272375.0,nw67cw,9,21,"I purchased a washer and dryer....

I recently received an email from Costco requesting feedback from my experience. I want to make sure my experience does not just stay in a survey so I am writing here some of what I wrote on the survey. This has been the worst experience I've ever had with any retailer in my life.  From the long wait, the lack of truthfulness from Costco representatives and the delivery team. 

When I initially received the W/D the stacking kit was missing. It was my fault because I was not aware I needed one since my previous W/D did not require one. The delivery team contacted the Costco rep to notify the stacking kit was missing. I was advised by the Costco rep over the phone that I should order one through Costco Online or Amazon and as soon as I receive it to notify them in order to send the delivery team for installation. I immediately logged in to Costco Online just to find out that the item was not sold separately. I decided to chat with the rep who told me to order to item from amazon and then call back. I asked her if she could wait a minute as I was placing the order at the same time we were chatting. I purchased the item and advise her. She reached out to Costco Logistics to schedule the appointment. It turned out that the Costco Logistics team stated that I would lose any warranty because the stacking kit was not purchased from Costco and the Delivery Team will not install anything that what's on the box they deliver. The Costco rep stated that my only option was to cancel my order and purchase a new W and D with the stacking kit. By them, the Delivery team had already left my house with my old washer and dryer and the new ones left in my garage. I advised the Costco rep the delivery team was gone to which she replied that they will not turn around because I accepted the delivery.

So at that moment, I found myself with no washer and dryer so I placed a new order for which I had to wait almost two months and about the same time for them to pick up the new ones left in my garage. Yes, they could not use the new ones sitting in my garage. I had to get new ones.

Once I received the new ones, the Delivery Team told me that the W and D will not fit in my laundry room. Yes, this was after I was the previous team had installed the washer from the first delivery. After going back and forth with the now disgruntled and repulsive delivery guy who even told me that he would install them but if they did not fit he was not going to take them back. Once upstairs he refused to place the W and D on top of a dripping pan to protect the home from water leaks.  At that time I was so fed up due to the entire situation that I decided it was not worth arguing with the guy. I can also continue ranting but for what.

Immediately disappointed when I opened it to find 2 small bags of cauliflower with fluid, and 2 small bags of sauce. In all, it was maybe 1/3 of a medium to large sized $2 cauliflower. I'd expected breaded/battered cauliflower - I guess I overlooked the ""paleo"" and ""keto"" buzz words on the labelling.

The instructions warn you to drain the broth from the ""sous vide"" vegetables, and once you open the package and smell it, you understand why. Even with the broth drained, the cauliflower in the finished dish was plasticky or chemical in taste.

The 2 sauce bags contained the General Tso's sauce - okay in flavor but just a plain cornstarch-based sauce.

So basically this is non-fresh produce and cornstarch sauce with a layer of cardboard packaging, a plastic tray and a lid, containing plastic-wrapped produce and sauces.

It was edible but I couldn't quite get over the strange taste in the cauliflower. I just feel suckered

The guys ended up arriving at my house unannounced... I had a bad feeling about things once that happened.  Sure enough, the guys were really rough with the tv and packaging, opened the box and seemed surprised by how thin the tv was (as if they'd never installed a new tv before), dropped the tv out of the box and damaged the corner of the screen, and moved random stuff in my house that didn't need to be moved (I just don't like it when people touch stuff without asking beforehand, as I had cleared the entire living room beforehand to make enough room for them anyway).  Needless to say it was a really bad experience.

Thankfully though, when I called costco to describe the experience, the were very nice, refunded the install fee, and will be back next week to switch the tv out with another one.  I just hope it's not the same people again because that would be really awkward.

Anyway, it seemed strange that I haven't really read bad experiences like this, but I thought I'd fill in in case someone was debating on whether or not to get the 20 dollar set up charge.

The nearest Costco is a little bit of a drive away and I can't always make it. So the new shipping options would help me order cheese, meat and snacks right to my door. Or so I thought. 

I have previously ordered using 2-day shipping, where one of my items was delivered (I kid you not) after two weeks. No harm, no foul, things happen. The other stuff that was supposed to be delivered in 2 days wasn't delivered in 2 days either. You know, not a problem‚Ä¶ it was a new feature then. 

But I recently ordered with 2-day shipping again, and it's been 2 days yesterday, and the order status still shows ""order is being prepared"". I have a feeling it won't be getting delivered before mid-week next week. 

Contrast that with the experience we have all had with Amazon. When they say ""two day delivery""‚Ä¶ they mean two day delivery. 

As retail industry has moved on and evolved, I am fearful that Costco will be left behind. I love the company and what it stands for. I love that they treat their employees much better. I was hoping Costco will set yet another standard in home delivery logistics while maintaining their reputation for treating their employees well. 

I am willing to forgive Costco a lot of things just because I'm not donating to the Bezos Empire every time I need something delivered to my house. Because this current order was delayed, won't mean I will die. But I do want the best for Costco, and I am afraid that most customers just want delivery to be held to the Amazon standard.

551,driven2D,1622998760.0,ntq7w1,14,29,"The KS Ultra Clean liquid laundry detergent was on sale so I decided to give it a shot since it had pretty good reviews.  It was a pretty bad experience for me, but YMMV.  The scent is a little strong, but the real problem is how sudsy it is, especially since I have a front load HE washer.  The suds would build in volume and not rinse away easily, unlike most HE detergents.  I reduced the dosing every time to basically a teaspoon, would use an extra rinse, but it was still very sudsy and my towels were getting stiff.  I don't have soft water either (pretty medium, San Jose CA area).

&#x200B;

Then I had 2 loads of laundry throw an error on my machine mid-wash.  I searched online and the error code means that the machine is overflowing with water (it wasn't) or there are so many suds that it's tripping the overflow sensor.  I did notice the pump seemed to be running excessively long when initiating a spin cycle.  I re-washed that load with just water, and a lot of soap came out.  Then I ran the machine clean cycle and the amount of detergent build up after \~1 month of use was incredibly bad.  I knew the detergent had to go back.  Thankfully, Costco is great with returns, and I found my interaction with the CS rep interesting:

&#x200B;

""Hi, I'd like to return this please.  It's way too sud...""

""Clogged up your machine?""

""Yup.  Clearly you must get this a lot?""

""All the time.""

&#x200B;

So, I just wanted to pass along a warning of my experience with this product.  It seemed to clean well, but it started to damage my washing machine, and apparently I'm not alone.  I switched back to Tide (which was actually way cheaper on sale at Safeway than at Costco), and everything works perfectly again.  No more suds, build up, or error codes, and my towels are softer and fluffier again.",Costco,Oversudsing with KS Ultra Clean Laundry Detergent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ntq7w1/oversudsing_with_ks_ultra_clean_laundry_detergent/

Last week I purchased these Melona frozen bars. Price approximately $0.35/each in box of 24. They tasted OK. I looked at ingredients and discovered they were made in Korea.

That made me think about what seemed to me impossible supply chain economics.

Made/frozen/packaged in Korea then shipped to my west coast Costco. 

1. Freezer truck to airport or shipping port in Korea.

2. Frozen shipping on plane or ship. 

3. Freezer truck from US port/airport to Costco. Customs fees etc.

4. Unpacking and stocking in Store. 

5. Cost of maintaining frozen until sold.

How is this even possible at this price? Are there freezer containers on ships? Are bulk air freight for frozen goods that low?

Probably not the correct reddit to ask this question but maybe someone here has an insight how this might work. If these were made in SF or LA I could understand the economics but Korea?",Costco,Supply Chain Economics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ns7zcj/supply_chain_economics/

673,evendree72,1622606149.0,nqcr6q,56,120,"I have been in almost all ancillary departments except, hearing aid, optical, photo, and tire center...  

My love is the deli, I started in the deli, and I wanted to move up, I was told it would be easy,  just work hard and learn as much as you can.

I learned meat department, food court, front end, member services, did S.I.T, went back to the deli, and I am a merchandiser.   I have always wanted to move up in the deli, for years I put in for supervisor spots, and was told, someone with more seniority, or knowledge, always got it, and I needed to know other areas of the warehouse.  Cool, I did that!

I tried again a few years later, was told I was was not knowledgeable enough with the AS400, and reports.  So I learned what I could access. 

Tried again. 
Was told I didn't know the Lingo enough.  Like the acronyms.   Okay. I went back to my manager and begged her to teach me. My department is one of the busiest in the region.  She refused  because we are too busy and she doesn't want to waste precious time outside of me and producing because I am one of her top producers.

She bullies and verbally tears down her crew of people and everyone is so used to the terrorizing ways we just take it and kept our heads down.  

Like I want to move up so fucking bad. Yet I have been told so much I am too nice, too talkative. Too friendly.  I have been told I will never move up over and over again by my old manager. 

I tried again recently,  I feel broken and so disheartening because even after 15 years of being a sponge, working my ass off, I am never good enough.  I know I am fat. I know I am not always the fastest. I get my job done.  What the fuck does it take to move up anymore.  It seems I must need to be a total brown noser or worse. I am not buddies or friends with managers,  nor do I want to be. I stay clear of being too friendly outside of work. I have seen some absolutely atrocious people be moved up who have no clue how to manage, have horrid communication skills. And yet they are all managers. 

Costco has broken me. I love and I hate Costco, but it's all I know, and I love working in the deli.  I want to be a deli manager some day but now I know.  I will never be anything but a grunt.

Costco has destroyed any self confidence I have had in the past. I have applied for over 13 years to probably 100 different supervisor spots. Nothing.  I came close once. I used to interview well, but my old manager did a number on my head, I stumble on my words and get so nervous now. Because I fear rejection, I know I am already rejected before I even try. They always have someone picked out anyways. Interviews are usually just formalities now days.  

I have been passed up for people I have so much more knowledge and experience on, and it will come to light they have family members that are managers in other stores,, its just so damn disheartening.   I don't know why I even try anymore.  Costco has destroyed my desire to be anything better because the rejection is destroying me.  Because they just want their good grunt workers to stay down so they can be pushed to the breaking point.  

I am so damn sad, angry at myself for wasting away my life and never getting farther. I wanted to grow with this company, I wanted to teach and help people grow. I wanted to be a deli manager. I am just the fat, annoying talkative person. I want to know what will make me good enough.  Will I ever be good enough? 
I have always been told I am a good teacher, patient, kind and very knowledgeable,  but its never enough!

693,christinathestorygrl,1622629834.0,nqipxw,17,4,"I've had terrible luck.  I've purchased four portable ACs from Costco over the last nine years and three of them were defective, failing within 18 months, four months, and the new one I got last week had broken caster wheels and started leaking after only two days of operation.

Despite this failure rate, I've told literally dozens of people that Costco is THE only option for buying a portable AC.  If you look at reviews on Costco and other sites, all portable ACs have like a 20-30% failure rate, and the manufacturers' warranties are worthless because you have to pay hundreds of dollars in round-trip shipping to utilize them.   The Costco return policy is your only protection against getting a $500-700 lemon.  I'm so passionate about protecting my friends and coworkers from this possibility that I've done everything except grab people by their lapels to get them to order through Costco rather than Amazon et al.

Well, now I've received my third AC lemon and it has to be returned.  We're of course going to replace it with another Costco portable AC, but I am TERRIFIED that I might get my membership revoked for doing another ""big"" return.

I think I'm a good Costco member!  I've had the Costco Visa card for years and I bought my home and car insurance through Costco.  I use Costco Optical and Pharmacy.  I shop at Costco once a week for groceries and that's my only gas station.

I do maybe two or three minor returns a year for issues like a foam pillow having a strong chemical odor or a clothing item not fitting.  Never anything stupidly abusive like returning a dead Christmas tree or a rotisserie chicken carcass or an 8 year old printer.

But returning a third portable AC unit freaks me out!  Does this seem like too much? Should I preemptively talk to a supervisor or the store manager?  Does anyone have any insight into what might trigger Costco to cancel your membership?

EDIT TO ADD:  

Well, my boyfriend and I returned the AC to the warehouse and the returns person said her own AC, also purchased at Costco, broke after a year!  So she was pretty sympathetic. When I told her I was afraid of getting kicked out of Costco, she said, ""no way, this is fine.""

Costco opened their first store in China last year.  While they have stores in Taiwan, Korea and Japan already.

This first store in China is their largest and after one year produced 400,000 memberships!  It's in Shanghai, one of the largest cities but still! 

They have 2 more Chinese stores under construction in China.

I watched a video of the CEO walking through the store showcasing how great the low prices were.  The host asked if they could make more by raising the prices and the CEO laughed so hard!  ""That's not us!""

Costco's Mission:

""Here at Costco, we have a very straightforward, but important mission: to continually provide our members with quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices.""

Costco stock pays a dividend, but occasionally they will pay an extra dividend to reward investors!  Yes, their great service extends to shareholders too!

Costco stock has increased 24% int he past year and 165% over the past 5 years.

786,blacksoxing,1622463746.0,np268i,16,0,"Obviously Citi issues the card - Costco just offers the benefits. YET, on the 21st I saw a large purchase that would have been sense using the Costco Citi promotion and applied for a card on Costco's website at the checkout screen. This is important. After being approved I realized I only received an email for the last 4 digits of the card. Couldn't sign up on Citi's website with that info, but amazingly if I wanted to renew my Costco card (that was due in a few days...) I could see the card's last 4 on Costco's website, so OBVIOUSLY there was some form of communication between Costco and Citi, even if I couldn't use the card to renew (or check out)

Called Costco that following Saturday after going into the store to inquire about how to pay for this large item. Got a temp card to renew my stuff, but the temp card doesn't work online. Gotta call Citi. Called Citi. Was told I have to wait for the physical card in the mail - no way to expedite. NO WAY TO EXPEDITE?!?!? So at this point I've likely pulled a hard credit to get a CC that I can't use. No virtual cards and no way for Citi to help me pay for what was on Costco's site.

Now, I almost focused my hate exclusively on Citi as they issued the card...BUT COSTCO ADVERTISES SIGNING UP FOR THE DAMN CARD WHEN CHECKING OUT!!!! Imagine if you were about to drop $4k on something on Amazon and they were like ""hey, sign up for our CC....thank you. You're approved! Now wait 7-10 business days for the actual card to come in the mail before purchasing. But don't worry, we'll send hourly reminders that you have items in your shopping cart!!!!!""

Last Weds I got a notice in the mail...that my card was on its way. Full of promotional crap that had no bearing on me. Naturally my large purchase went Out of Stock the day the promotion ended and now I have a CC that I couldn't use. I'll wait for a 4th of July sale or whatnot just so I can exercise the warranty feature, but if that wasn't the case I'd use my Discover card, get that 5% back for warehouse purchases online, and dip. 

Costco: You shouldn't try to pimp a card at the checkout screen if folks can't use it ASAP. Citi, you shouldn't act like you can't expedite a card for first-time issues. If it was a replacement I could have allegedly had it FedEx, which blew my mind. Furthermore I read on a forum that if you claimed you were doing international travel that may trigger the release; I shouldn't have to lie to get a card to use!

I was having issues with my iphone X and was way past due for an upgrade. u/Costco told me purchasing at Verizon was terrible and Costco, my trusted retailer, would give me a better service experience. I told him exactly what I wanted- 12 mini in red, case, trade in, pay in full and transfer my stuff. He said no problem and we started. First, they had no red or symmetry case. Fine, just get it done. He sent me to pay but they only took $50 for tax. He explained I couldn't return it if I paid in full and to NOT pay Verizon until I was sure I would keep. Sure, ok. AFTER I was an hour spent into the process he warns me he probably won't be able to transfer my stuff. I was furious. I calmly explained this was his #1 selling point against Verizon in the first minute of his speal and it was unenthical to disparage them for something he couldn't do anyway. Blah, blah, blah. He said (all puffed up and bullish) he was sorry I was upset and did I want to finish. I was 90 minutes in and my old phone wasn't working so I said fine. At the end I asked about my trade in and he said I had to do it with Verizon! WHAT?

I called Verizon when I got home and he lied about the pay in full and return policy and he signed me up for a 2 year contract, which I have not for 10 year. (I signed NOTHING and the word was not mentioned.) I have to return it before I can do anything more to fix. I have an appt at their store to have them fix everything. I truly cannot believe Costco would allow a business like that to operate in their stores. Shameful!

P.S. Per the comments- the issue is he outright lied about several things and signed me up for a contract that I did not consent to. It was NEVER EVEN MENTIONED and I did not sign anything...and yes, I have transferred my stuff from icloud before. i was looking to have it all done at once but acknowledge the convenience probably doesn't trump security. :-) Verizon will make it right but this was fraudulent.

The complete lack of training, braindead management, rampant nepotism, sexual harassment, revolving door of employees, and fickle safety procedures are just a few of my concerns. Our warehouse manager asking Covid-positive employees who didnt show symptoms to still work their shifts is yet another concern.
Being screwed out of my Covid bonus as a part timer who works full time hours is, again, yet another concern.

When I started, I really gave it my all, but it slowly faded, starting with when they promoted a man in the warehouse who was well known to sexually harass every female coworker in the store, all because he was cozy with management, not because he was even remotely close to fulfilling his job description.

The only reason I‚Äôve stayed at all is to transfer out of state then immediately look for something else after moving. I‚Äôve been sending out transfer requests and job bank applications left and right since the start of this year, and can‚Äôt seem to secure anything or get any opportunity to leave my warehouse. I‚Äôve put in for almost 40 jobs, interviewed for about half of those applications. Nothing.

Look, I‚Äôm remaining cautiously hopeful that this is just my current store, not the company as a whole. I would love to transfer to see if an older more established warehouse has it‚Äôs shit at least somewhat together. But what now? I‚Äôm in great standing, near perfect attendance, perfect reviews, and even letters of recommendation, but I get nothing but transfer denials, rejection letters, or just complete radio silence on any job transfer I apply to.

Is it even worth trying to transfer with this company? Because my mental health means much more to me than Jelinek‚Äôs stock going up a quarter of a percent.

There is a Costco warehouse opening in my region in about a month and a half; having heard only good things about their optical department, I applied for a full time non licensed position yesterday. I have read that most full time positions are given to transfers and that it is difficult to be hired full time if you are not currently employed there. However, since the nearest Costco is a minimum of 2 hours away (possibly less transfers?) and I would be coming in pre-trained, I was feeling pretty hopeful when I applied.

I am curious to know when to expect a response from them- will they contact me even if they‚Äôre rejecting my application? I also asked that they not contact my current employer because I haven‚Äôt told my employer I‚Äôm applying for a new job- will that hurt me since I asked them not to contact the only place where I have optical experience?

Hi, I have been a member since the Price Club days. I have always told people they should buy TVs from Costco because they are a no hassle return/repair/replace store. I said this having never returned anything before. I used the concierge system once and was directed how to reset my TV which solved my issue back then. Last year I bought a TCL 50"" from Costco, and it worked great. Thirteen months later, the TV failed by displaying only vertical purple and black bars. I have gone through at least 7 - 10 calls over the past month. They could never get through to service dispatch. I was told multiple times that I would be called by them in 24-48 business hours. In frustration, I took the TV to the store where I was informed that they couldn't take the TV back or help me in any way without authorization. I called concierge services again and went through the usual pattern of waiting while they tried to reach someone in service. After yet another 30-45 minute call, I was given the number to call service myself. Late last week I was finally able to get a call through to service dispatch. I was given instructions how to take 4 pictures and email them in. I did this. I still didn't hear anything. I resized the pictures in case the files were too large and resent them. several days later still nothing so I called again. I was told that the pictures didn't clearly show all four corners of the TV, but I had trimmed the photos down to just the TV to make the file smaller. I was informed that I need to take all of the pictures again and resubmit. them wait 2-3 business days before checking back. They will not reach out, you must continually call them. So, I guess I am venting because I will likely not have resolution until next month, at least after Monday. Is this typical?

I have a question regarding orientation day!
When have yall hear back about the orientation day after getting hired?

I did my interview about 2 weeks ago I heard back from my manager that I got hired. She explained the terms over the phone and told me to wait to hear back about the orientation date. 

I am in Canada and the department I have applied for is pharmacy. Keeping in mind that my availability starts from June 1st (due to my school and the manager was fully aware of it), it has been 2 weeks since she hired me and I still haven't heard back about my orientation date. I did contact the manager last week and she said she is still waiting to hear back as well. So I am starting to get worried. Like I haven't signed any document or whatsoever. 

Is it normal to take this long to hear back about orientation? Or did I get laid off before I even had my orientation üòÖüòÇ?",Costco,Costco orientation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/nkjxf9/costco_orientation/
